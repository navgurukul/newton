## Home Row, keys f, j, d and k

Now, we'll practice the keys `f`, `j`, `d` and `k`.
Position your left index finger on the left groove on the keyboard, and your right index finger on the right groove of the keyboard. Look away from the keyboard and feel the grooves with your fingers and try to find them by moving your fingers away.
As an exercise, type the following text without making any mistakes.

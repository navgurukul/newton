## Top Row, keys  q, e, p

In the this part of the top Rows tutorial, we'll learn the use of keqys `q` , `e`, `p`
Position your left middle and index finger on the left groove of the keyboard, and your right middle finger on the right groove of the keyboard. The top row keys will be one level above the home row keys. With each of your middle and little fingers, try to reach the keys `q`, `e` and `p`, and try to remember the movement. Look away from the keyboard and feel the grooves with your fingers and try to find them by moving your fingers away.

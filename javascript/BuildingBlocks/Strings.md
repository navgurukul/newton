# Strings

```javascript
> "Navgurukul"
```

and

```javascript
> "Let us change the world!"
```

These are strings. Strings are stored inside **"** and **"**

Strings can be stored inside variables just like numbers.

Example:

```javascript
> var mySchool = "Navgurukul";
> var ourMotto = "Let us change the world!"
```

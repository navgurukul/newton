# Complaints

The student body is free to raise any complaint or bring to notice any issue that needs to be addressed through an open forum. It is the duty of the respective council members to address any such issue raised within three days.

In order to ensure quick resolution of campus affairs, the DISCO will take stock of all unresolved complaints on a weekly basis.

Any complaint against one or more members of the DISCO will be addressed by the Board of Governors. 
 
If a disciplinary action is taken against a member of the Council, the member will be up for review by the Board of Governors.

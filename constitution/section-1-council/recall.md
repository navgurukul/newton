# Right to Recall

During the three month tenure of the different members in the Council, if the student body finds the Council members to be unresponsive, evasive of their responsibilities, they can do the following:

- Raise the matter in the GBM and state your reasons for discontent. The concerned council member is accountable to answer the questions. 
- If the matter needs immediate attention, you can immediately raise your concern on the appropriate communication channel.
- Petition for dismissal of the concerned member from the Council. You can raise the petition to the DISCO (described in later sections). The DISCO will conduct an anonymous vote. If 2/3rd number of all community members vote in favour of the petition, the concerned member will be dismissed from the Council.
- In case there is a petition for removal of DISCO, the petition can be raised to the GenSec. The GenSec will conduct an anonymous vote. If 2/3rd number of all community members vote in favour of the petition, the DISCO will be put under review and call for dismissal will be taken by the Governor.

The Right to Recall safeguards the Council from faltering in their responsibilities.

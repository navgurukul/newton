## Interim Responsibilities

In the event that a council member has to leave campus for few days such that they are not able to fulfil their responsibilities, it is their duty to handover the council responsibility to someone who will take care of it in their absence.

* Absence for <= 14 days: Consult with GenSec and figure out if Council member can play their role remotely. If not, handover responsibility to any existing Council member. If no Council member can take it up owing to other responsibilities, then results of election can be revisited and the person who got second highest votes for the profile, can take up the role temporarily.
* Absence for > 14 days: Re-election for the profile

Any Council member who is absent from council without handing over responsibility will be asked to resign from the Council. They will further not be eligible to participate in the following elections.

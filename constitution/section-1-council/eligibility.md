# Eligibility to contest for Council

Students who have been in NavGurukul for **2 months or more** at the time of elections can contest for **Council** elections. This will not hold if there are less than 3 candidates contesting for a profile. 

Students who have been in NavGurukul for **6 months or more** at the time of elections and has been a council member once (current or former), can contest for the **GenSec** profile. 

In such case, the eligibility to contest elections will decrease by one month, till the point we donâ€™t have three contests eligible and contesting for the profile.

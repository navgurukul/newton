# Right to Dissent

A healthy community strives not only on favorable views, but equally importantly on the **contrarian views** as well. For the sake of efficiency, usually the contrarian views are handled with contempt while **dissent** and **whistleblowing** are seen as acts of distraction. NavGurukul's constitution believes that in the interest of fairness and long-term growth, dissent and whistleblowing are important and valuable parts of the system. Hence, constitution gives every member a "right to dissent" where the member can directly raise a concern which needs to be addressed by the Council in presence of the Board of the Governors. Members are encouraged to actively exercise their dissent and **expose loopholes** in the systems.

Our constitution salutes all the Whistleblowers that have helped the World in becoming a better place.

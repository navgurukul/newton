# Right to Audit

Elected members are facilitating the well-being for all the members, and hence members have all the right to delve into the **processes, accounts and records** being maintained to find more efficient solutions or expose discrepancies. It will be the prerogative of the Council to arrange for the right information to be made available to the member for this purpose. Such an audit can be done under the supervision of the Board of Governors if the member desire to do so.

Council is advised to **document** its decisions electronically - through documents or through channels on the communication application such that they are available to all the members of the Center, and to others on the request. Members are **encouraged to give feedback** on these decisions if they believe anything can be done with a better approach or if they believe some wrong decision is being taken. They can also use their “Right to Dissent” or “Right to Audit” to escalate the matter.

At the same time, there are duties that are important to be followed by each student. It should be the duty of all students at NavGurukul to:
- Abide by the constitution and follow all process and rules set up by the constitution
- Uphold all the values that NavGurukul stands by, which includes - respect for each other, courage to stand up against something which is happening wrong, honesty in work and ideas, openness and transparency, and to move together on a path from ignorance to truth.

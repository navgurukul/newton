section-5-rules_key3=NavGurukul campus is a drug and alcohol free campus. While we don’t intend to do moral policing, we believe that drinking while enrolled in the course distract students from learning and create uncomfortable situations for others. Therefore, we don’t approve of students consuming alcohol on or off-campus for the duration of the course.
section-5-rules_key4=All students will abide by the schedule that has been created by the Disciplinary committee.
section-5-rules_key5=No student will indulge in any kind of activity that will bring bad repute to NavGurukul. Prohibited activities include but are not limited to:
  1. Requiring the use of alcohol in any process or activity
  2. Throwing or propelling substances or objects at individuals or groups
  3. Verbal abuse or threatening physical harm
  4. Forcing a person to eat or drink something against his or her will
  5. Requiring a person to do something potentially harmful, or against their will, to themselves or other individuals.
  6. Any form of stalking, molestation or sexual abuse
section-5-rules_key6=All community members must report any incident of any kind of misconduct to disciplinary committee
section-5-rules_key7=Off-campus Activities: At NavGurukul, an individual’s learning heavily relies on peer learning and this is only possible when there is consistent availability of all members of the learning group on the campus. To achieve this, it is important that members of a learning group are available on campus during study hours. Therefore, we encourage the disciplinary committee to limit off-campus leisure activities to specific times of the day. This is also important to ensure safety and security of all community members across the campuses.

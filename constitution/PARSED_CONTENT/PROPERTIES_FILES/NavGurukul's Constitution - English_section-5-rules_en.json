	"section-5-rules_key6": "Off-campus Activities: At NavGurukul, an individual’s learning heavily relies on peer learning and this is only possible when there is consistent availability of all members of the learning group on the campus. To achieve this, it is important that members of a learning group are available on campus during study hours. Therefore, we encourage the disciplinary committee to limit off-campus leisure activities to specific times of the day. This is also important to ensure safety and security of all community members across the campuses.\n"

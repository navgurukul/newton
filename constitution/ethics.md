## Ethics of the Election
Elections are a very core process in NavGurukul. It is extremely important that the entire process of elections and appointment of Council is fair and gives equal opportunities to all who are eligible to participate. The DISCO will ensure that the Council elections on campus are fair. This means that all nominated students get an opportunity to present their case to the community as to why they should be elected to the respective profile.

Also, it should be communicated to the community before every election that they have to vote for the person who they think is most suited for the profile. If after the election, the DISCO and Governor feel that the elections were not fair in any way, they can disqualify the election. This would be followed by a re-election.

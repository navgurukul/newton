```
**Save your code as a python file (with `.py` extension) and submit it.**

This question is divided into different parts. All the code has to be written and uploaded in a single python file.

# Part 1

  
Take a `string` input from the user using `raw_input` in `var1`.


# Part 2
In `var2` take another `string` input from the user using `raw_input`.



# Part 3
Join `var1` and `var2` ,then print the result.

  
*e.g. if `var1` contains string `"nav"` and `var_2` contains `gurukul` , then `navgurukul` should be printed.*

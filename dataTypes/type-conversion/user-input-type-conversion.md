# Introduction

In this section we want to take input from user using python. Then we'll also explore doing type conversions with that input.

In the future ,very often we will have to take some input from our users. To take an input in Python we use `input`. eg:

```python
user_input = input("Kuch input daaliye ")
```
When it runs, python will stop and a cursor will appear. Here you have to put some inputs. Press 'Enter' after you have made your input. Now when you `print` user_input, whatever value you had enter will be in the form of a string in the `user_input` variable.
```python
print (user_input)
```

# One more Example

Let us understand this in more detail by taking an example of another input.

```python
number1 = input("Ek number daalo ")
```
Look here that we have put a string inside the brackets of raw_input. The value of this string is "enter a number". Whatever string we put inside the inner brackets, that string is printed by Python before asking for input. It gives some hint to the user as to what to input. Like in the example above, python will print `"Put a number"` before asking for input. And when the user presses `enter`after typing in a number (input) ,variable `number 1` the value will have that value.

If we do `print number1` in the python shell, then whatever value we have entered, will be printed.

# Type Conversion of User inputs
  
Whenever we take user input from `input` to a variable it is in the string type. Meaning, whatever the user puts in, raw_input makes it a string.
```python
number2 = input("Ek number daalo ")
```
Here the data type of `number 2` will be string. Whenever we take the value of a variable as input from `input`,that value is in the form of a string. If the user has also input a number, it will be in the form of a string.

```python
print (type(number2))
```

Like if here we entered 25 then `number 2` would contain "25". Any value that has 'quotes' in front of it is a string. To convert it to integer we have to use `int()`.

```python
number3 = int(number2)
print (type(number3))
```

##  One more type conversion and `raw_input` example.

Below is a final example to understand all these things better. This example prints two numbers by taking the input and multiplying them.

```python
number_x = input("Pehla number daaliye ")
number_y = input("Dusra number daaliye")
number_x = int(number_x) # raw_input se hume number_x string type mein mila
number_y = int(number_y) # raw_input se hume number_y string type mein mila
print (number_x * number_y) # number_x aur number_y ka multiple kar ke result print hoga
```

Here it is important to understand we convert `number_x` and `number_y` to integer before multiplying because with `input` we get input always in the form of a string.

**Fun Activity:** Run this example without converting `number_x` and `number_y` to `int` and see what error occurs. Google this error and try to solve it. Talk to your friends around you too. For this you will have to remove the lines with `number_x = int(number_x)` and `number_y = int(number_y)`.

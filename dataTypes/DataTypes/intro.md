## What is a Data Type ?
As we read the English book, every word in it is English, means the *information is in English*. Whatever knowledge we are taking from the book is *data*, and the language is its *type*.


`Data type` indicates the type of `information`.

The `Data type` represents a type of value that determines which operation can be performed per data. For example, `numeric`, `non-numeric` or `Boolean (true/false)` data are the most commonly used data types.


Data Type is a very important concept in `Programming`.

We can store different type of data type in a variable. Like `Numeric`, `Characters`. Every `programming` language has data types.

### Below are some data types in Python


Numeric type - (Integer, Float, complex)

Text type - (String)

Boolean type - (True, False)

Sequence type - (List, Tuple, Range)

## Academic Circle or Learning Circle

This is a very important circle or meeting in which all the students gather/sit together in a circle to discuss the following:- 
- Tell about their current topic and their **future agenda** and their **new learning** in the previous week.
- TNP’s conduct this circle and they also ask some questions to the students on their respective topics.
- Needs of students that need to be worked for the next week.
- The **academic circle** is conducted once every week, but it can also be conducted twice a week depending on the need of academics.
- **TNP’s** update the progress tracker sheet for every student and also in the dashboard.
- Student’s current milestones will be updated on the progress sheets.

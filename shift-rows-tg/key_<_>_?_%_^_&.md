## Shift Row, keys :, ", #, $ and *

In this part of the Shift Rows tutorial, we'll try to type few shift keys which are present on the number pad (which is placed above the top row) and also from the top row. 
Position your left index finger on the left groove on the keyboard, and your right index finger on the right groove of the keyboard. 
Look away from the keyboard and feel the grooves with your fingers and try to find them by moving your fingers away. 
From now things will be a liitle more chanllenging as you have to click two keys at the same time, which is why we suggest you to take it slow at first and focus on type 
each key correctly and then eventually you will see an increase in your speed with respective shift keys.

Go on then! Start Typing!

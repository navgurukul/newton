Revision (Home Row+Top row) (Chapter of v and m keys)

Baby vagary burst vary ruby valuta but vast vault vulgar by


Ham gum jam ran gum man fun mat nab arm sun may nut tun mud
Hang damm harm darn farm hung lamb rang sand tang tank many
Must bank gang busy hand thank bury junk human marry funny
Numb bush ray baulk flask bald stuff bask shark navy hurry

The quiet pigs were equally happy 
Have live lives lives give gave
Five sheep gave her their wool 
Twelve voles float over the river
As tree grew grass waved grass were watered trees were fed


Letter m

Me my ma mum mother
Most of the family were at the farm
The small purple mark was a mystery
Home row top row 
Always keep to the home keys
Five sheep give wool

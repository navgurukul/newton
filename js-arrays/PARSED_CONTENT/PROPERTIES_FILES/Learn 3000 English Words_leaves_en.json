	"leaves_key2": "NavGurukul’s one-year residential program is an intensive program. It requires your **extraordinary commitment**, **passion** & **hard work**. The program relies on **peer learning**, and expects you to be **available all throughout the year** to maximising your learning and ensure that every student learns well. \n",
	"leaves_key3": "NavGurukul isn’t a conventional school or college, instead is like a family or a home. Students are expected to stay here, learn, celebrate their joys and festivals, share their sorrows and help each other in their journeys. \n",
	"leaves_key4": "There are no official leaves including that of festivals like Diwali, Eid or Christmas. Hpwever there are a few exceptions as follows:\n",
	"leaves_key5": "Upto **12 days leaves** in case of death of an immediate family member - father, mother and siblings\n",
	"leaves_key6": "Upto **4 days leaves** in case of death of close family members - grandparents, uncles, aunts\n",
	"leaves_key7": "Upto **20 days leaves** (once in the entire year) for university/college exams\n\n\n",
	"leaves_key8": "Yet, if the student needs to take leaves for any other purpose - health (personal or family), important event or ceremony which can’t be avoided, etc. student needs to inform about his leave to the Center Incharge **at least 3 days in advance**. The student has to spend **two days in community serving** for each leave that he or she takes. The rationale of this policy is the realisation, that **any leave by the student hurts the interest of the entire group**. Hence, by engaging in community serving student can think responsibly and also add value to the community.\n"

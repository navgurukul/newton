	"clicking-browser-buttons_key10": "Most boring tasks aren’t limited to the `files` on your computer. Being able to programmatically download web pages will extend your programs to the Internet.

	"clicking-browser-buttons_key11": "But to fully automate any web-based tasks, you need direct control of your web browser through the selenium module. The selenium module will allow you to log in to websites and fill out forms automatically. Since a web browser is the most common way to send and receive information over the Internet, this is a great ability to have in your programmer toolkit.\n"

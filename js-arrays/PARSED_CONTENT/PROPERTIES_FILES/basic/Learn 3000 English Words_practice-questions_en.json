	"practice-questions_key33": "Write a function named collatz() that has one parameter named number. If number is even, then collatz() should print number // 2 and return this value. If number is odd, then collatz() should print and return 3 * number + 1.\n",
	"practice-questions_key34": "Then write a program that lets the user type in an `integer` and that keeps calling collatz() on that number until the function returns the value 1. (Amazingly enough, this sequence actually works for any `integer`—sooner or later, using this sequence, you’ll arrive at 1! Even mathematicians aren’t sure why. Your program is exploring what’s called the Collatz sequence, sometimes called “the simplest impossible math problem.”)\n",
	"practice-questions_key35": "Remember to convert the return value from `input`() to an `integer` with the int() function; otherwise, it will be a `string` value.\n",
	"practice-questions_key36": "Hint: An `integer` number is even if number % 2 == 0, and it’s odd if number % 2 == 1.\n",
	"practice-questions_key37": "The `output` of this program could look something like this:\n",
	"practice-questions_key38": "Enter number:\n3\n10\n5\n16\n8\n4\n2\n1\n`Input` Validation\nAdd try and except `statements` to the previous project to detect whether the user types in a non`integer` `string`. Normally, the int() function will raise a Value`Error` `error` if it is passed a non`integer` `string`, as in int('puppy'). In the except clause, print a message to the user saying they must enter an `integer`.\n"

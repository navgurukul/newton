Your computer’s clock can schedule programs to run `code` at some specified time and date or at regular intervals. For example, your program could scrape a website every hour to check for changes or do a CPU-intensive task at 4 AM while you sleep. `Python`’s time and datetime modules provide these functions.\n",
	"keeping-time-scheduling-tasks-and-launching-programs_key3": "You can also write programs that launch other programs on a schedule by using the subprocess and threading modules. Often, the fastest way to program is to take advantage of `applications` that other people have already written.\n",

Enter the following into the interactive `shell`:\n",
	"the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key3": "These methods are useful alternatives to the == equals `operator` if you need to check only whether the first or last part of the `string`, rather than the whole thing, is equal to another `string`.\n",
	"the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key4": "The join() and split() `String` Methods\nThe join() method is useful when you have a list of `strings` that need to be joined together into a single `string` value. The join() method is called on a `string`, gets passed a list of `strings`, and returns a `string`. The returned `string` is the concatenation of each `string` in the passed-in list. For example, enter the following into the interactive `shell`:\n",
	"the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key5": "Notice that the `string` join() calls on is inserted between each `string` of the list argument. For example, when join(['cats', 'rats', 'bats']) is called on the ', ' `string`, the returned `string` is ‘cats, rats, bats’.\n",
	"the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key6": "Remember that join() is called on a `string` value and is passed a list value. (It’s easy to accidentally call it the other way around.) The split() method does the opposite: It’s called on a `string` value and returns a list of `strings`. Enter the following into the interactive `shell`:\n",
	"the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key7": "By default, the `string` 'My name is Simon' is split wherever whitespace characters such as the space, `tab`, or newline characters are found. These whitespace characters are not included in the `strings` in the returned list. You can pass a delimiter `string` to the split() method to specify a different `string` to split upon. For example, enter the following into the interactive `shell`:\n",
	"the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key8": "A common use of split() is to split a multiline `string` along the newline characters. Enter the following into the interactive `shell`:\n",

It prints a title, PICNIC ITEMS, centered above the `tab`le. Then, it `loops` through the dictionary, printing each `key`-value pair on a line with the `key` justified left and padded by periods, and the value justified right and padded by spaces.\n",

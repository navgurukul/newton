	"rotating-and-flipping-images_key2": "Images can be rotated with the rotate() method, which returns a new Image object of the rotated image and leaves the original Image object unchanged. The argument to rotate() is a single `integer` or `float` representing the number of degrees to rotate the image counterclockwise. Enter the following into the interactive `shell`:\n",
	"rotating-and-flipping-images_key3": "Note how you can chain method calls by calling `save`() directly on the Image object returned from rotate(). The first rotate() and `save`() call makes a new Image object representing the image rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees and `saves` the rotated image to rotated90.png. The second and third calls do the same, but with 180 degress and 270 degress. The results look like Figure 17-7.\n",

	"rotating-and-flipping-images_key5": "Notice that the width and height of the image change when the image is rotated 90 or 270 degrees. If you rotate an image by some other amount, the original dimensions of the image are maintained. On Windows, a black background is used to fill in any gaps made by the rotation, like in Figure 17-8. On OS X, transparent pixels are used for the gaps instead.\n",
	"rotating-and-flipping-images_key6": "The rotate() method has an optional expand `key`word argument that can be set to `True` to enlarge the dimensions of the image to fit the entire rotated new image. For example, enter the following into the interactive `shell`:\n",

Here was pass Image.FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT to flip the image horizontally and then save the result to horizontal_flip.png.

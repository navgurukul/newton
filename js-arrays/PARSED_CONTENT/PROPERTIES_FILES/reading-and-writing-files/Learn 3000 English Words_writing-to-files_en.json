	"writing-to-files_key2": "`Python` allows you to write content to a `file` in a way similar to how the print() function “writes” `strings` to the screen. You can’t write to a `file` you’ve opened in read mode, though. Instead, you need to open it in “write plaintext” mode or “append plaintext” mode, or write mode and append mode for short.\n",
	"writing-to-files_key3": "Write mode will overwrite the existing `file` and start from scratch, just like when you overwrite a `variable`’s value with a new value. Pass 'w' as the second argument to open() to open the `file` in write mode. Append mode, on the other hand, will append text to the end of the existing `file`. You can think of this as appending to a list in a `variable`, rather than overwriting the `variable` altogether. Pass 'a' as the second argument to open() to open the `file` in append mode.\n",
	"writing-to-files_key4": "If the `file`name passed to open() does not exist, both write and append mode will create a new, blank `file`. After reading or writing a `file`, call the close() method before opening the `file` again.\n",

	"writing-to-files_key8": "Hello world!\nBacon is not a vege`tab`le.\nFirst, we open bacon.txt in write mode. Since there isn’t a bacon.txt yet, `Python` creates one. Calling write() on the opened `file` and passing write() the `string` argument 'Hello world! /n' writes the `string` to the `file` and returns the number of characters written, including the newline. Then we close the `file`.\n",
	"writing-to-files_key9": "To add text to the existing contents of the `file` instead of replacing the `string` we just wrote, we open the `file` in append mode. We write 'Bacon is not a vege`tab`le.' to the `file` and close it. Finally, to print the `file` contents to the screen, we open the `file` in its default read mode, call read(), store the resulting `File` object in content, close the `file`, and print content.\n",
	"writing-to-files_key10": "Note that the write() method does not automatically add a newline character to the end of the `string` like the print() function does. You will have to add this character yourself.\n"

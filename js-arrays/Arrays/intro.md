## Arrays

Think about a list of your favourite things. For example, 

your mother’s name, Ramani


Your favourite colour, Black


Your favourite number, 1


Your birthdate, Jan 2, 1996

Now imagine you had to store them together as myFavouriteThings in JS. To do this you will use an Array Data Type


An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in a single variable.


The simplest way to create an array is by specifying the array elements as a comma-separated list enclosed by square brackets, as shown in the example below:

```js
var myFavouriteThings = ["Ramani", "Black",1, "jan 2 1996"];
```

Same like myFavouriteFriends

```js
var myFavouriteFriends = ["shweta", "rani", "nayak", "kajal"]

```

Which you can relate with lists in python.

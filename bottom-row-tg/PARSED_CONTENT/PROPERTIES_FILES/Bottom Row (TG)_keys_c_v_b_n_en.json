The bottom row `keys` will be on level below the home row `keys`. With each of your middle and index fingers from both hands, try to reach the `keys` `c`, `v`, `b` and `n`, and try to remember the movement. Look away from the `key`board and feel the grooves with your fingers and try to find them by moving your fingers away.\n"

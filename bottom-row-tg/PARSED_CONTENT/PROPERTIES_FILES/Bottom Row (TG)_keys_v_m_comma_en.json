The bottom row `keys` will be on level below the home row `keys`. With your index,middle and ring fingers, try to reach the `keys` `v`, `m` and `,`, and try to remember the movement. Look away from the `key`board and feel the grooves with your fingers and try to find them by moving your fingers away.\n"

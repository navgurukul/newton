## Bottom Row keys v and m

In the first part of the Bottom Rows tutorial, we'll learn the use of keys `v` and `m`.
Position your left index finger on the left groove on the keyboard, and your right index finger on the right groove of the keyboard. The bottom row keys will be on level below the home row keys. With each of your index fingers, try to reach the keys `v` and `m`, and try to remember the movement. Look away from the keyboard and feel the grooves with your fingers and try to find them by moving your fingers away.

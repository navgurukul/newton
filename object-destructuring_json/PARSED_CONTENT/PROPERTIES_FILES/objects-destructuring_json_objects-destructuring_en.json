	"objects-destructuring_key3": "Here navgurukul.mentor is referring to Priya and that is assigning to name a new <span style=\"\">variable</span>.<br>And one navgurukul.mentee is referring to Sapna and it is assigned to mentee another new <span style=\"\">variable</span>.",

	"objects-destructuring_key6": "As you can see in the above example, the object from the Left hand side has the properties mentor and mentee with the values Priya and Sapna respectively. Note that you need to give the same property names in ({mentor,mentee} = navgurukul); , so that mentorâ€™s value from navgurukul will store into mentor in curly braces and same for mentee.

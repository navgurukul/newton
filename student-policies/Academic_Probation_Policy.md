## Introduction

### What is Probation?

If a student does end up on academic probation, don't panic. Being placed on academic probation is usually not the same as being asked to leave campus. Students are given a probationary period to demonstrate that they can indeed make successful academic progress.  

Academic probation is to indicate that a student is not making progress Navgurukul required for completion of the software development course. It also means that a student’s grades and/or overall performance are not high enough to continue on campus if they do not improve.  

### What leads to Academic Probation?

Every student who is joining Navgurukul will be in the probation period for the first two months. A student is further placed on Academic Probation based on the following criteria.  


- Based on the review of Coaches and Academic Associate, if it is found that a student is not serious about their academics
    - And is not cleear with their previous concepts
    - Making unnecessary excuses to avoid coding continuously for 15 days,
    - Not giving 7 hours at least for coding in a day.
- If a student is failing to maintain 70% of their engagement in academic activities such as
    - Conducting Stand up,
    - Participating in Academic circles,
    - Involving in Pair-Peer Learning
    - Taking classes
    - Conducting and participating in interviews,
    - Mentoring students
    - Attending volunteer run sessions
- If the student receives three red flags continuously in weekly assessment tests.

### How can you clear the Academic Probation?

- The student should be given a personal mentor and an advisor in resolving academic probation
    - They will take the assistance of their assigned mentors daily in solving their problems in learning.
    - Once in a week T&Ps will interview probationary students.
    - Assigned mentors will give updates to Academic associates on alternate days. Students should make extra efforts and give extra time to studies, a change in his/her day to day schedule and share a proposed timeline to cope up with the studies.
- Make a list of what he/she needs to do day-wise for a month
    - Week 1 : Dry run needs to be done till the topic that student is doing under the guidance of the respective mentor, and then T&P will interview them and then work on feedback.
    - Week 2: Each student needs to plan 3 classes till the topic with proper
documentation which they need to share before the class and T&P will interview
them, then work on feedback.
    - Week 3: Sprint and Projects decided by academic associates.
    - Week 4: For checking their improvement we will give a new topic to complete
within the timeline.
    - The academic associates will take the final interview.
Set up a personal hackathon often in this period, if needed

name: Cultural Probation Policy
```

### 1. Introduction

The purpose of the policy is to create a safe environment in the campus with
regards to herself and others including the students and team members. The
need of the policy is to provide a space for the student to reflect, understand and take accountability and responsibility for his/her actions and reactions.


Keeping in mind the usage of probation in the current document is not to provide
any form of threatening and non-inclusivity approach. It is drafted in a way
aligning to the thought and vision of the organization, NavGurukul, which caters
to re-working and supporting the overall performance of the student.

### 2. What leads to culture probation?

Where a student has been found responsible for violating the environment,
discipline, rules and regulations and has been engaged in an activity which
is unacceptable and poses threat to the immediate community.

### 3. SOP needs to be followed during Culture Probation

#### Step 1: 

There needs to be a detailed conversation regarding the student between
the DISCO and community manager about the history of the student.

#### Step 2 : 

If the incidences of disciplinary issues are surpassing the limit, the
community manager will loop in the Program Manager along with Program lead
for discussing the issue in a joint call.

#### Step 3: 

As the second warning will be provided by the Program Lead along with
the campus team to the student, which will be executed a) via joint call b) via
email with detailed information.

#### Step 4 : 

The email will be the third warning stage for the student , which will have
a probation tenure of the student (one month probation period), jointly decided
by the team.

#### Step 5: 

The final stage will be suspension. After following all the above steps if there is no sign of improvement, the campus team jointly with the lead will opt for suspension of the student and discuss the same with the associated
stakeholders (NGO Partners/Guardians).

### 4. Additional Step to be followed by Campus Team

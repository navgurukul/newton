	"Laptop_Policy_key19": "General care of the laptop should be taken care of by the student \n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key20": "Students are supposed to keep their laptop in their possession and within sight whenever possible, just as if it were your wallet, handbag, or mobile phone. Be extra careful in classrooms. It takes just a fraction of a second to cause damage to an unattended laptop. \n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key21": "Lock the laptop away out of sight when you are not using it, preferably in a strong cupboard, filing cabinet, or safe. This applies in the classroom or in your room. \n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key22": "When the laptop is not in use, please store it in a secure location \n",

	"Laptop_Policy_key27": "Virus and Threat\n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key28": "Viruses are a major threat to and laptops are particularly vulnerable if their anti-virus software is not kept up-to-date. The anti-virus software MUST be updated at least monthly. The easiest way of doing this is simply to log on to the network for the automatic update process to run. If you cannot log on for some reason, contact the IT Help/Service Desk for advice on obtaining and installing anti-virus updates. \n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key29": "Email attachments are now the number one source of computer viruses. Avoid opening any email attachment unless you were expecting to receive it from that person.\n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key30": "Always virus-scan any `files` downloaded to your computer from any source (CD/DVD, USB hard disks and memory sticks, network `files`, email attachments, or `files` from the Internet). Virus scans normally happen automatically but the IT Help/Service Desk can tell you how to initiate manual scans if you wish to be certain. \n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key31": "Report any security incidents (such as virus infections) promptly to the IT Help/Service Desk in order to minimize the damage. \n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key32": "Respond immediately to any virus warning message on your computer, or if you suspect a virus (e.g. by unusual `file` activity) by contacting the IT Help/Service Desk. Do not forward any `files` or `upload` data onto the network if you suspect your PC might be infected. \n",

	"Laptop_Policy_key35": "Unauthorized software\n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key36": "Do not download, install or use unauthorized software programs. Unauthorized software could introduce serious security vulnerabilities into the networks as well as affecting the working of your laptop. Software packages that permit the computer to be ‘remote controlled’ (e.g. PC anywhere) and ‘hacking tools’ (e.g. network sniffers and password crackers) are explicitly forbidden on equipment unless they have been explicitly pre-authorized by management for legitimate business purposes. \n\n\n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key37": "Unlicensed software\n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key38": "Be careful about software licenses. Most software, unless it is specifically identified as “freeware” or “public domain software”, may only be installed and/or used if the appropriate license fee has been paid. Shareware or trial packages must be deleted or licensed by the end of the permitted free trial period. Some software is limited to free use by private individuals whereas commercial use requires a license payment. Individuals and companies are being prosecuted for infringing software copyright: do not risk bringing yourself into disrepute by breaking the law. \n\n\n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key39": "Backups\n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key40": "Unlike desktop PCs which are backed up automatically by IT, you must take your own backups of data on your laptop. The simplest way to do this is to log in and `upload` data from the laptop to the network on a regular basis – ideally daily but weekly at least. If you are unable to access the network, it is your responsibility to inform such issues to IIT Help/Service Desk\nLaws, regulations, and policies \n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key41": "You must comply with relevant laws, regulations, and policies applying to the use of computers and information. Software licensing has already been mentioned and privacy laws are another example. \n\n\n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key42": "Inappropriate materials\n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key43": "Navgurukul will not tolerate inappropriate materials such as pornographic, racist, defamatory, or harassing `files`, pictures, videos, or email messages that might cause offense or embarrassment. Never store, use, copy or circulate such material on the laptop and steer clear of dubious websites. IT staff routinely monitor the network and systems for such materials and track the use of the Internet: they will report serious/repeated offenders and any illegal materials directly to management, and disciplinary processes will be initiated. If you receive inappropriate material by email or other means, delete it immediately. If you accidentally browse to an offensive website, click ‘back’ or close the window straight away. If you routinely receive a lot of spam, call the IT Help/Service Desk to check your spam settings. \n\n\n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key44": "Enforcement\n",
	"Laptop_Policy_key45": "Any student found to have violated this policy may be subjected to disciplinary action in line with the Policy.\n"

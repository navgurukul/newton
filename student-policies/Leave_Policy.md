# Leave Policy

*Effective since 1st February 2021*

NavGurukul’s one-year residential program is an intensive program. It requires your extraordinary commitment, passion & hard work. The program relies on peer learning, and expects you to be available all throughout the year to maximise  your learning and ensure that every student learns well. 

However, keeping your needs and well-being in mind, certain leaves have been allocated for you if you wish to avail them. We trust that you will use these leaves wisely and with full consideration towards your studies at NavGurukul.

**Academic Leaves:** You can avail leaves from NavGurukul if you have college exams coming up. You will have to submit your exam schedule to the concerned person to avail these leaves. Preparation leaves of maximum 2 weeks can be taken (if needed) just before the exam. Information about upcoming college exams should be shared with the NavGurukul team during your admission.

**Medical Leaves:** You can apply for medical leave in case you need to go home in the event of illness that requires severe medical attention or surgery. You would be required to present a medical certificate to avail this leave for upto a period of 14 days.

**Personal Leaves:** You can take leaves for personal reasons that are not academic/medical in nature for upto 14 days or 2 weeks. The allotment of personal leaves will be the discretion of the facha. This could include leaves for any reasons related to your family or your emotional health.

You can avail these leaves when needed provided that you have applied for the leave well in advance. Also, the following conditions apply for leaves.

* You are only eligible for personal leaves if you don’t have any exams lined up throughout the year i.e. you cannot avail both academic and personal leaves. Personal leaves also can’t be taken if you have already taken medical leaves.
* You have to apply in writing at least 2 weeks in advance for academic / personal leaves. 
* You can only leave the campus if you get permission in writing from the facha. 
* At any given point of time, not more than 10% of the students from a campus can be on leave. 
* Personal leaves cannot be taken during the probation period. 
* Personal leaves cannot be taken during the first 4 months of your time in NavGurukul.

### Process of Applying for Leaves

* You need to fill the leave application form at least 2 weeks in advance.
* You need to write an email addressing the facha and keep the Program Manager and DISCO in cc.
* You will receive an email once your facha has reviewed your application and either approved/ disapproved your leave.
* In case of any grievances, you can revert to the facha in charge through email only. They will review your grievance and revert to you.


### Unauthorized Leaves

Taking unauthorized leaves or extending your leaves without a valid reason and proper communication hurts the interests of the community and belittles the trust that has been placed in you. Therefore, we would urge you to communicate and plan honestly and well in advance for your leaves. In the case that you take unauthorized leaves, disciplinary action might be taken. We hope you will act responsibly.

The leave policy can be revised as and when needed. 

### Holidays

There is one weekly holiday on campus. The day of the leave is decided jointly by the community and campus team. Students can choose to take rest or go out of the campus on this day. However, they have to be back on campus by the curfew time. Sometimes, due to some academic reason or community related reasons, this holiday could be cancelled or rescheduled. The community is expected to cooperate in such circumstances.

### Festivals

Festivals are a time to celebrate and spread laughter and joy within the community. We don’t encourage students taking leaves during festivals. The community can together decide which festivals they wish to celebrate together. These days will not be holidays but celebration days. The community members are encouraged to participate in preparations for the days and make it a day of fun and frolic. It will not be considered as a holiday in which they can go out. Every campus can have their own celebration days.

	"Functions_key1": "You probably already know what a function is. Here is what a function looks like in JS.\n",
	"Functions_key2": "We define functions so we can use them again and again. \n",
	"Functions_key3": "For example, in the function above, we define the function drawCircle once, and then everytime we need to make a circle, we just call that function.\n",
	"Functions_key4": "Before we use a function, we need to define it. The most common way to define a function in JavaScript is by using the function `key`word, followed by a unique function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a `statement` block surrounded by curly braces.\n",
	"Functions_key5": "Function is a block of `code` you can call as many times as you want. A function is a group of `statements` that perform specific works and can be kept and maintained separately from the main program. Here are some advantages of using functions:\n",
	"Functions_key6": "**Functions decrease the repetition of `code`** —  Function allows us to get commonly used blocks of `code` into a single place. Now you can perform the same event by calling this function wherever you want within your `code` without writing the same block of `code` again and again.\n\n",
	"Functions_key7": "**Functions makes the `code` much easier to handle** — Because a function created once can be used multiple times, so any changes made inside a function automatically goes at all the places without touching the all `files`.\n\n",
	"Functions_key8": "**Functions makes it easier to eliminate the `errors`** — if any `error` occurs you know exactly what function caused the `error` and where to find it. Therefore, fixing `errors` becomes much easier in your `code`.\n"

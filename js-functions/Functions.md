# Functions

You probably already know what a function is. Here is what a function looks like in JS.

```javascript

function drawCircle(center, radius) {
 
 // Code to be executed

}
 
```

We define functions so we can use them again and again. For example, in the function above, we define the function drawCircle once, and then everytime we need to make a circle, we just call that function.
 
Before we use a function, we need to define it. The most common way to define a function in JavaScript is by using the function keyword, followed by a unique function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement block surrounded by curly braces.

Function is a block of code you can call as many times as you want. A function is a group of statements that perform specific works and can be kept and maintained separately from the main program. Here are some advantages of using functions:

- **Functions decrease the repetition of code** —  Function allows us to get commonly used blocks of code into a single place. Now you can perform the same event by calling this function wherever you want within your code without writing the same block of code again and again.

- **Functions makes the code much easier to handle** — Because a function created once can be used multiple times, so any changes made inside a function automatically goes at all the places without touching the all files.

- **Functions makes it easier to eliminate the errors** — if any error occurs you know exactly what function caused the error and where to find it. Therefore, fixing errors becomes much easier in your code.

## Induction of New students:-

When new students step inside the campus, they have no idea where to go and what to do?
In order to resolve this problem of new students, we have come up with an idea explained in steps as below:-

- An **induction meeting** should be planned for the new student, where they should introduce themselves in front of the Team Members  as well as the Council Members.
- New students should be informed about the **community culture** as well as **Academics Time Table** followed at Navgurukul. This is the responsibility of Council members, Outreach team.
- New students should read this **NavGurukul Foundation Educational Structure doc** firstly by themselves to understand the academic procedure followed at the campus and then one **cultural activity** will be conducted for them to Brainstorm on that educational doc.
- **TNP (Training and Placement coordinator)** has to ensure that the new student should get a mentor by the second day.
- They should be introduced to the **Syllabus** by the Academic Associates that they have to complete within 9 months.
- Classes should be conducted for new students for about 3 weeks till operators and after that, the student will study on their own and with the help of their mentors.

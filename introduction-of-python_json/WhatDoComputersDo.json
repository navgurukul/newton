This was due to human physical limitations.<br>By the invention of WHEEL, humans were able to carry very heavy loads as well as to travel long distances also.<br>The world became smaller to us. Hence, the invention of WHEEL solved lots of problems. Now, we can even meet our relatives staying far off and transportation of goods also became easier."

What is the output of the following code?
```javascript

var firstname="Mahendra";
var lastName="Bathula";
console.log(firstname+" "+lastName);
 
// Feedback after submit: Mahendra Bathula

```
**Explanation**
Here we added two variables firstname and lastName which contain values Mahendra and Bathula respectively. When we are printing space in between so after printing Mahendra we will get a single space and Bathula.

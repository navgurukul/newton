Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

I am a ‘single quoted’ string inside ‘single quotes’.

```javascript
// please write code here
```
 
```solution
var myStr ='I am a \'single quoted\' string inside \'single quotes\'.';
console.log(myStr);
```

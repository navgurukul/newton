**Example:**
```javascript
var string1= "I am staying in the \"Sarjapur Campus\""
console.log(string1)
// output: I am staying in the "Sarjapur Campus"

```
**Explanation:**

    See in the above example, you want double quotes to Sarjapur Campus, but because the string is also in double quotes you can ignore double quotes that are there to Sarjapur Campus by using backslashes.

    See, when you are defining a string you can use single or double quotes, but somewhere if you want literal quotes( double quotes(“ “) or single quotes(‘ ‘) ) so to fulfill that need we can use backslash(\) to ignore literal wherever we want.


**Example:**
```javascript
var string1= "I am staying in the 'Sarjapur Campus' "
console.log(string1)

// output: I am staying in the 'Sarjapur Campus'

```
**Explanation:**

    If you just want single quotes around Sarjapur Campus you can put the whole string in double quotes and put Sarjapur Campus in single quotes. Or else vice-versa format also as shown below.



**Example:**
```javascript
var myFavPlace= 'My favourite place is "Paris"';
console.log(myFavPlace);

// output: My favourite place is 'Paris'

```

**Explanation:**

    If you like paris more and you want to put in single quotes, you put everything in double quotes and Paris in single quotes.

**Example:**
```javascript
var Name = "komal";
var name = "swati";
console.log(Name+name)

output: komalswati

```
**Explanation:**

    As variables are case sensitive. It means x and X are different variables. You can see clearly in this variable Name we have capital N and in this variable name we have n, both are different  to look at andlook  and JS feels also it as a different variable.


**Example:**
```javascript
var num_12 = 24;
console.log(12num)

Output :- SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token

```
**Explanation:**

    As the above example throws an error because according to the rules of naming variables, We can not use numbers in the starting of variables Like 12num . If we do it then our computer will be confused and will throw an error because it doesn’t know to start a variable with a number.

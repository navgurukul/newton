What is the error in the following code?
```javascript

	var str1 = "Welcome \tto my campus"
var str2 = "Welcome to\n my \tcampus"
console.log(Str1);
 
// Feedback after submit: ReferenceError: Str1 is not defined

```
**Explanation**
Because str1 is in small letters but we tried to console Str1 so it didn’t get Feedback after submitting that, it threw a reference error.

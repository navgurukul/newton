You can see clearly in this above two `variables` one is Name we have with N (capital N) and second one is also name but started with n (small n), both are different  to look and JS feels also it as a different `variable`.\n",

If we do it then our computer will be confused and will throw an `error` because it doesnâ€™t know to start a `variable` with a number.\n"

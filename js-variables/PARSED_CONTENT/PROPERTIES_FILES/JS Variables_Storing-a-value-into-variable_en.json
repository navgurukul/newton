	"Storing-a-value-into-variable_key5": "A `variable` is simply the name of a storage location and will work as a container to hold value. = (equal to ) is used to assign a value to a `variable`, if you do any operation such as addition, multiplication and it will compute first and assign it to the `variable`.\n",

Now in this example We added two `variables` myName and myFullName which contain the values “kumar” and “nayak vadthya” respectively and store it in FullName. So when we printed FullName it showed the value as kumar nayak Vadthya.\n"

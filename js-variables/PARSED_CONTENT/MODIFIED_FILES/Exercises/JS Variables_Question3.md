```javascript
var a;
var b;
var c;
console.log(a,b,c);
console.log(a+2);
```

```solution
undefined undefined undefined 

NaN

### Expalanation

When the variables are only initialized they have the value of undefined, thatâ€™s why when we tried to print before giving value it printed undefined undefined undefined and when you do mathematical operations with undefined it will tell you NaN(not a number).

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var. Some other keywords are also there to declare variables like let and const, about them we will learn in later of this document.

In javascript statements end with semicolons(;). Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

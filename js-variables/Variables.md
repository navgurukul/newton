name: Variables

### Example:
```javascript
var myName;
```

### Explanation:

In the above example it creates a variable called myName. And variables work like a container to hold the value that we give after equal to (=).

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var. Some other keywords are also there to declare variables like let and const, about them we will learn in later of this document.

In javascript we end with semicolons(;). Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

In the computer world data is everything which is meaningful to computers. We have so many different types of data types which are string, number, boolean, object , undefined , null etc.,

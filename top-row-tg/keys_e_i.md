## Top Row, keys e and i

In the this part of the top Rows tutorial, we'll learn the use of keys `e` and `i`.
Position your left index finger on the left groove on the keyboard, and your right index finger on the right groove of the keyboard. The top row keys will be one level above the home row keys. With each of your middle fingers, try to reach the keys `e` and `i`, and try to remember the movement. Look away from the keyboard and feel the grooves with your fingers and try to find them by moving your fingers away. Enter the following text once you're comfortable with the top row keys `e` and `i`

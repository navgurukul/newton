The top row `keys` will be one level above the home row `keys`. With each of your middle fingers, try to reach the `keys` `e` and `i`, and try to remember the movement. Look away from the `key`board and feel the grooves with your fingers and try to find them by moving your fingers away. Enter the following text once you're comfor`tab`le with the top row `keys` `e` and `i`\n"

They can have a 30 - 45 minute long session with the students and discuss extensively about the given topic. The idea is to offer larger exposure to students by helping them to engage them in one-on-one sessions. Some of the examples of the topics would be resume writing, understanding personal finance, gender sensitization, exposure in contemporary issues like politics or religion and so on."

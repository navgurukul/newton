name: Mock Interview
```

1. You begin by deciding on a job they would like to apply for. 
2. The group is then split into interviewers and candidates and each student is given a corresponding worksheet.  
3. The interviewers write down the details for the job, e.g. salary, hours of work, etc. 
4. The candidates discuss and write down the ideal profile a candidate should have for the job, e.g. the person’s age, work experience, etc. 
5. The interviewers then write down job interview questions for the items listed on their worksheet and the candidates write down questions to ask during the interview. After that, the interviewers and candidates are paired together and they begin the role-play. 
6. The interviewer’s task is to decide if the candidate is right for the job. 
7. The candidate’s task is to find out as much information as possible to decide if they want the job. When all the pairs have completed the job interview, the interviewers say what qualities they were looking for and if they found the right candidate. 
8. The candidates say what they thought of the job and if they would like to do it. Finally, pairs act out their role-plays.

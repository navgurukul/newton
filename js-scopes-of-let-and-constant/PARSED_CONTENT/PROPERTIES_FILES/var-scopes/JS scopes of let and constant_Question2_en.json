	"Question2_key5": "A display named function is there, inside that we have 2 if blocks. In the first if we defined two `variables` a and b with var and let `key`words respectively.  After that in the second if block we are asking to print a and b.. Because var is defined inside a function, it has function scope and it is going to print its value 10, but in the case of let, let is declared in inside first if block because of let is a block scoped we are not able to access it in another if block, it given us reference `error` b is not defined.\n"

##### What is variable scope?

Scope essentially means upto where in our programme we can access these variables and are ready for use.


In Javascript, the scope of a variable is handled or controlled by the location where the variable declaration has been declared.



Scopings may differ from one language to another language. In Javascript, it has two scopes,
Local / Function and global scope.

## Count Occurences

**Occurences** - is made from the word `occur` which means that how many times a certain character or word appears.

**Sample List**
```python
char_list = ["a", "n", "t", "a", "a", "t", "n", "n", "a", "x", "u", "g", "a", "x", "a"]
```

**Output of the Sample List**

[["a", 6], ["n", 3], ["t", 2], ["x", 2], ["u", 1], ["g", 1]]

a - 6 times
n - 3 times
t - 2 times
x - 2 times
u - 1 times
g - 1 times

We have to count the `occurences` of characters present in the `char_list` and we have to save in the `nested list`, then we have to use that nested list to print the output.


### `Edge Case`
```python
char_list = []
```

#### Solution
[]

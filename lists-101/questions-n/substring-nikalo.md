## Remove Substring

```python
mainStr = "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. the dog slept over the verandah."
subStr = "over"
```

You have to write a program in such a way that should remove all the occurences of `subStr` from `mainStr`. Means the output of the above program is given below.

```python
the quick brown fox jumped the lazy dog. the dog slept the verandah.
```

### Bonus Part
```python
mainStr = "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. the dog slept over the verandah."
subStr = "over"
replacementStr = "on"
```

Replace the `subStr` from `mainStr` using `replacementStr` and then print it.
```python
the quick brown fox jumped on the lazy dog. the dog slept on the verandah.
```

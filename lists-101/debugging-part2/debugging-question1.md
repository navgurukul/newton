## Question 1
Suppose, you have `marks` in a given list. We have written a code below in which we have calculated total marks as the sum of markst this. But this code doesn't runs. Debug this code and then submit it.

```python
marks = ["10", "32", "42", "65", "67", "89", "76", "38", "67"]
total_marks = 0
counter = 0
while counter < len(marks):
	total_marks = total_marks + marks[counter]
	counter = counter + 1
```
Save the corrected code in a file and then upload it.

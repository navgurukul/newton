## Question 2

In this code, name of the user should be printed but the code is not running properly and not giving the correct output.
```python
name = ["Savitri", "Phule", "26"]
# Ab hum iss list ko use karke poora naam (full name) print karna chaste hai
print(name[1]+name[2])
# Code mei dekhiye naam theek se print kyu nahi ho raha
```

Correct this code and upload it.

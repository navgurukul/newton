## Sorting
**Sorting** is a very important process, you will come across it quite often. Sorting (Sort is the **root word**) means to arrange in some order like arranging any sequence by height, weight, by name, by marks, etc.

#### Example :-
- Arrange marks from lesser to higher (**Ascending Sort**).
- To sort names alphabetically (**Chronological Ascending Sort**).
- Arranging height from lesser to higher(**Ascending Sort**).
- Arranging weight from higher to lesser(**Descending Sort**).
Bubble sort is a way of sorting, that arranges a sequence of numbers, in **ascending** or **descending** order.

### Understanding Bubble Sort

Look at this diagram. You can read about `Bubble Sort` from here also [yahan](https://medium.com/karuna-sehgal/an-introduction-to-bubble-sort-d85273acfcd8).

1. Compare 1st and 2nd elements.
   - If the bigger element is afterward, then don't do anything.
   - If the bigger element is before only, then swap it.
    (**swap** means - **interchange** - replace the first element with the second one, and the second element with the first one).
2. Now, do the same with 2nd and 3rd i.e.compare the elements and swap them.
3. Repeat the same process.
   - The largest number after one **iteration** will reach the extreme right.
4. These iterations will run as many times as there are number of elements present - by this, the `array` will be sorted.

First, do this with the help of **notebook and pen**, this will improve your understanding.

Then, implement this **algorithm** with the help of a code. This is a difficult question, if it takes 4 to 5 hours to do this, then also okay.

Write a program that tells how many elements are there in a given list. It is similar to `len() function`, so in order to implement this program we will not use `len() function` but we will try to understand that how did any programmer implemented this `len()` function.

```python
numbers=[50, 40, 23, 70, 56, 12, 5, 10, 7]
```

After writing this code, upload this code :)

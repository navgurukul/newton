## What do we mean by lists?

You might have studied about `string`, `integer`, `float` and `booleans` data types. These are called `primitive data types` where `primitive` means `simple` data types. We can use `primitive data types` to make `complex data types`. `List` is one of the `complex data type`.

### Exercise

- What 10 things do you want to do in your life, make its list.
- Now, store it in a `python variable`.

----------
In this way, you will get a lot of `information in the form of a list`.      Example :-

- Make a list of Groceries that you want to buy.
- Make a list of Courses that you can do at NavGurukul.
- Make a list of questions that you have to do in a given course.
- List of all the good habits that you have.
- List of Companies where you want to work.
- List of students present in the campus.
- List of Council members 

etc.

We will see that how important it is for us to study `List Data Type and List Data Structure`.

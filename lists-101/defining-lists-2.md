## MIXED LISTS

Its not like that lists should have same type of data. Data inside list can be of any type.

#### Example:-

```python
mixed_list = ["rahul", 12, 9.0, "kaavay", "shivam", 1]
print(type(mixed_list))
```
But, this is not a very **common practice**. Usually we keep same type of Data in a list.

## `Report Card`

Please see this list :

```python
marks = [
    [78, 76, 94, 86, 88],
    [91, 71, 98, 65, 76],
    [95, 45, 78, 52, 49]
]
```
These are the marks of any student for the last three years. You have to calculate total marks for all the three years.


Sum of the nested list given above - 1142.

### `Edge Cases`
Check your program for following nested lists as well (your code should run without making any change, if its not running properly then that means that you have not written the code properly ) :

```python
marks = [
    [78, 76, 94, 86, 88],
    [91, 71, 98, 65],
    [95, 45, 78]
]
```

Sum of the nested list given above - 965.

```python
marks = [
    [78, 76, 94, 86, 88],
    [91, 71, 98, 65],
    [95, 45, 78],
    [87, 67, 49, 68, 88]
]
```

Sum of the nested list given above - 1324.

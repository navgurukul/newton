## Report Card - Part II

Please see this list :

```python
marks = [
    [78, 76, 94, 86, 88],
    [91, 71, 98, 65, 76],
    [95, 45, 78, 52, 49]
]
```
This is the list of marks of a student for the last three years. You have to calculate the average marks for each year.
Like, for the above list, the output should be as follows:- 
   Average of 1 year  - 84
   Average of 2 year  - 80
   Average of 3 year  - 63


### `Edge Cases` 
Check your program for following `nested lists` as well ( the code should run without changing the code, if it does not runs properly thatt means you have not written the code properly :

```python
marks = [
    [78, 76, 94, 86, 88],
    [91, 71, 98, 65],
    [95, 45, 78]
]
```
Through your code the output of the above list should be as follows :


    Average of 1 year - 84
    Average of 2 year - 81
    Average of 3 year - 72


This list should run without any error, if your program is **robust** :
```python
marks = [
    [78, 76, 94, 86, 88],
    [91, 71, 98, 65],
    [95, 45, 78],
    [87, 67, 49, 68, 88]
]
```

Through your code the solution of the above `nested list` should be as follows :

    Average of 1 year - 84
    Average of 2 year - 81
    Average of 3 year - 72
    Average of 4 year - 71

## Ethics of the Election
Election NavGurukul ka ek core aur important process hai. Ye bahut zaroori hai ki Council ke Elections aur Appointments bilkul fair hon aur jo bhi eligible ho use participate karne me barabar ki opportunity mile. DISCO ensure karega ki campus me Elections bilkul fair tareeke se hon. Iska matlab ki sabhi nominated students ko community ke saamne apne aap ko present karne mauka mile ki kyun wo us respective profile ke liye elect kiya jana chahiye. 


Community ke sabhi members ko ye elections se pehle hi communicate kiya jana ki wo usi nominated member ko vote karein jinhe wo us profile ke liye sabse suited maante hain. Agar elections ke baad, DISCO ya Governor ko kisi bhi tarah se aisa lagta hai ki elections fair nahi hain, to wo election ko disqualify kar sakte hain. Iske baad Re-elections conduct kiye jayenge.

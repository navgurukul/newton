## Interim Responsibilities
Agar kisi council member ko kuch dino ke liye campus se bahar jaana hai aur wo us duration me apni responsibilities poori nahi kar sakta to, aise case me ye us council member ki duty hai ki wo apni responsibilities kisi ko handover karke jaye jo unki absence me sabhi kaamo ka dhyaan rakhe.
* Absence for <= 14 days: GenSec se consult karke pata lagana ki kya wo Council member apni respnsibilities remotely poori kar sakta hai. Agar nahi, to apni responsibilities kisi existing Council member ko handover karke jaana. Agar koi Council member wo responsibilities nahi nibha ke liye taiyaar nahi hota to Electios ke results ko revisite karna padega aur jis nominated member ko 2nd highest votes mile the, wo member temporarily us profile ki responsibility le sakta hai
* Absence for > 14 days: Uss profile ke liye re-elction kiye jayenge


Agar koi bhi Council member apni responsibility kisi ko handover kiye bina campus se jaata hai to usse resignation maanga jayega. Wo aage aane wale elections me participate nahi kar payenge.

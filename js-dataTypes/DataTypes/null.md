## Null

This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.

A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.

**Example:**

```js
var a = null;
console.log(a); // Output: null
var b = "Hello World!"
console.log(b); // Output: Hello World!
b = null;
console.log(b) // Output: null
```

**Exercises:**

1. Write a program to print null when I console a variable name is y?

```js
var y= null;
console.log(y);
```
2. What is the output of the following code?

```js
var val = null;
console.log(val);

Output: Null

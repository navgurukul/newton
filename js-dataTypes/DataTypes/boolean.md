## Boolean

The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc. as demonstrated below:

```js
var isStanding = true;   // this means -- yes, I'm standing
var isStudying = false; // this means -- no, I'm not studying
```

Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons in a program. The following example compares two variables and shows the result in an alert dialog box:

```js
var a = 2, b = 5, c = 10;
console.log(b > a) // Output: true
console.log(b > c) // Output: false
```

```ngMeta
name: Number
```


### Example:

```javascript
var a = 25;         // positive integer
var b = 80.5;       // floating-point number
var c = -2;         // negative number
```

Here in the above we stored a positive number i.e., 25 in a variable named a. 
The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place.



### Example:

```javascript
console.log(16 / 0);  // Output: Infinity
console.log(-16 / 0); // Output: -Infinity
console.log(16 / -0); // Output: -Infinity
```

The Number data type also includes some special values which are: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN. Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity âˆž, which is greater than any number. Infinity is the result of dividing a nonzero number by 0, as demonstrated above.


### Example:

```javascript
console.log("Nav Gurukul" / 2);       // Output: NaN
console.log("Dharamshala" / 2 + 10);  // Output: NaN
console.log(Math.sqrt(-1));         // Output: NaN
```


While NaN represents a special Not-a-Number value. It is a result of an invalid or an undefined mathematical operation, like taking the square root of -1 or dividing 0 by 0, etc.

### Exercises:

1. Write a program which will give output True by comparing two variables?

```javascript
//please write code here
```

```solution
var num1=5;
var num2=6;
console.log(num2>num1);
```

2. What is the output of the following program?

```javascript
var a = 3;
var b = 5;
console.log(b<a);
```

```solution
false
```

3. What is the error in the following code?

```javascript
var a = 3;
var b = 5;
console.log(!=a);

```solution
output:SyntaxError: Unexpected token '!=' 

Because we need to compare here two variables that means b!=a should be there not !=a.

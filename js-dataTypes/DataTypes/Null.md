```ngMeta
name: Null
```



### Example:

```javascript
var a = null;
console.log(a); // Output: null
var b = "Hello World!"
console.log(b); // Output: Hello World!
b = null;
console.log(b) // Output: null
```

This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.

A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.

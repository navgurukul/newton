```ngMeta
name: Undefined
```


### Example:

```javascript
var a;
var b = "Hello World!";
console.log(a); // Output: undefined
console.log(b); // Output: Hello World!
```
variable a is just declared and not assigned any value in it, whenever you will try to print before assigning a vlaue you will get undefined.

variable b is declared and assigned a value i.e., Hello World!

### Note

The **undefined** data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, it has the value undefined.

### Exercises:

1. Write a program that prints undefined when I print with its variable name?

```javascript
//please write code here
```

```solution
var z;
console.log(z);
```

2. What is the output of the following code?

```javascript
var n;
console.log(n);
```

```solution
undefined
```

3. What is the error in the following code?
```javascript
var x=3;
console.log(X);
```

```solution
output: ReferenceError: X is not defined 

Because X is not defined here, JS is case sensitive so that's this x and this X is different.
```

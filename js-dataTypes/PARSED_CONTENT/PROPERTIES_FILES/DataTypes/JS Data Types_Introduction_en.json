	"Introduction_key3": "**Data types** consist of two different words, **Data** and **Type**. Let’s understand this one by one. Data means information and type means what kind of information. Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.\n",
	"Introduction_key4": "For example, when we write the following line in JS,\n",
	"Introduction_key5": "The `variable` my_name can store some information. And the type of that information is a `String`, like ‘Shweta’ in this case.\n",
	"Introduction_key6": "There are **six basic data types** in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: primitive (or primary), composite, and special data types. `String`, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.\n",
	"Introduction_key7": "Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas composite data types can hold collections of values and more complex entities. Let's discuss each one of them in detail.\n"

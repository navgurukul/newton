name: Variables kya hote hain?
```

- Explain the concept of how variable is a store of value. It's like an empty box which can take in any content.

- Currently instead of doing the explaining work, we can just refer them to the variable section in the Python course.

- Print things like var a = 12; console.log(a);

- Show how to change value of a variable.

//Variables
var a = 3;
var b = 4;
console.log(a + b)

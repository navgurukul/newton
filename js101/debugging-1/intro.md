name: Galtiyan pakadna aur theek karna
```

- Explain the concept of debugging. How it is important to debug things. How it is one of the most important things a programmer does.

- Here we should also try and explain the concept of errors in JS. These errors should be told from two prespectives:
a. Writing Code in Console and error in the console
b. Writing code in a file and the error showing up in a console.

- Tell them how read a stack trace to see which line the error is coming on.

- Explain them a simple error like Variable naming error & basic syntax error like missing brackets.

- Ab hum dusron ke code mein kuch galtiyan sahi karte hain.

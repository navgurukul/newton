**Process**

Make simple tarot cards. For example, you can draw simple pictures or symbols representing
* Family
* Travel
* Love
* Home
* Children
* Happiness
* Wealth
* Work
* Education
* Power
* Entertainment

The number of the card sets should correspond with the number of pairs of students in your class.

Divide students into pairs and give each pair a set of the cards. Ask students to draw cards and tell each other their fortunes. 

To make the activity more challenging and interesting, a Fortune teller needs to include at least 3 sentences in each fortune.

	"activities_key5": "Family means a lot to most people, and this activity gives you a chance to talk about your family, and ask and answer questions about your and your group members’ families. Each person can bring in one or more pictures of their family. The person introduces their family to the group, and then the class members ask questions about those people.\n",
	"activities_key6": "**20 Questions**\nThe rules are simple. Someone chooses an object. It can be anything – a person or a place. Then the other student takes turns asking questions and trying to determine what that object is. The class limit is twenty questions (hence the name), and those include the final guesses. (E.g. Is it the Sydney Opera House?) If the student guesses the object correctly, they win the round. If not, the person who chose the object wins.\n"

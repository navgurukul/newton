### Blindfold - Learning in the Dark

1. Each person of the team will become "Follower" and "Leader" one by one.
2. The “Follower” will be blindfolded and will need to accomplish an easy transfer task, such as take a pen and put it on a certain person’s laptop.
3. The “Leader” will be given a task card and is responsible to help the “Follower” get to the destination successfully.
4. When the “Follower” successfully accomplishes the task, they reverse the roles and repeat the same process.

When you feel a little lost in the movie, you can pause, read the subtitles, understand it and then move forward. You don't have to read the subtitle word by word,instead just use them to get the gist (the idea) of something if the speech becomes too fast that you can’t understand what the characters are saying.
2. **Listen and Repeat**: The beauty of watching a recorded movie online or on a DVD is that you’re able to pause and go back if you don’t understand – something you can’t do with your English teachers in the classroom. Go back to a part you didn’t understand and say it out loud. Repeat it a few times and read what the subtitles say. 
3. **Keep a movie journal**: While you watch your movies, pause the video when you hear something that you might find useful in the future or new words or phrases that you like and write it down in a journal.

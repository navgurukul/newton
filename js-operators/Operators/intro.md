# Operators

## What is an Operator?

Think that you are performing an arithmetical addition problem. In that you are adding two numbers and printing them

```javascript
console.log(1+2); // output: 3
 ```
An operator performs some operation on operands (data value on which operation is being performed) and produces a result. For example 1 + 2, where + sign is an operator and 1 is left operand and 2 is right operand. + operator adds two numeric values and produces a result which is 3 in this case.

In JavaScript, an operator is a special symbol used to perform operations on operands (values and variables on which operation is being performed).

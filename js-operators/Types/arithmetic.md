## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic (Mathematical) operations on the operands. The following operators are known as JavaScript arithmetic operators.




| Operator | Description | Example |
| ---------- | ------- | -----------|
| + | Addition | 10+20 = 30 |
| - | Subtraction | 20-10 = 10 |
| * | Multiplication | 10*20 = 200|
| / | Division |  20/10 = 2 |
| % | Modulus (Remainder) |  20%10 = 0 |
| -- | Decrement |  var a=10; a--; Now a = 9 |
| ++ | Increment |  var a=10; a++; Now a = 11 |
| ** | Exponential (power) |  2**3 gives you 8 |


## Exercises:

```javascript
var x = 10, y = 20;
 
console.log(x + y);
console.log(y - x);
console.log(x * y);
console.log(y / x);
console.log(x % 2);
console.log(x++);
```

Output:

30

10

200

2

0

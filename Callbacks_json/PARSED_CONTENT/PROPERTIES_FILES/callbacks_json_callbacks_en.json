	"callbacks_key3": "A callback function is a function (it can be any name function, anonymous function or an arrow function) passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action given. (Developers say you “call” a function when you <span style=\"\">execute</span> a function, which is why callbacks are named callbacks)",

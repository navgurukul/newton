Privilege is what separates us from someone who never went to school. When we achieve something, we feel that we have an important role in achieving that. While it can’t be argued otherwise, but at the same time role that the privilege might have played to make that happen may be far greater than you have imagined to be. Privilege is a big topic of its own, and we would encourage you to read more about it on the Internet. By the way, the fact that you are able to use Internet has also been made possible because of the privilege you enjoy. In India, only 33% people have the privilege of using the Internet."

While we strongly argue that the students coming out of the system should serve people, we clearly understand and believe that you would have your own style of serving people, and no particular format of service is expected. You can choose to serve in your own ways, that suits you, that makes you happier."

We believe that rather than postponing to serve in the future, start serving in a small way that makes you happy and isn’t too hard on you. The idea of serving in future, rather in present would be lucrative to one and all. And it would be expected that you are truthful to yourself, and realise an urgent and important need to serve others."

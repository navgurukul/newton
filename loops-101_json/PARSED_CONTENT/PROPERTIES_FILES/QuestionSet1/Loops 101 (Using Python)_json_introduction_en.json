	"introduction_key2": "In this section, some questions are given. Solutions to some of the questions are given. If you want, you can see the solutions directly. But that will not at all help you. It would be better that first try that question for at least 1 hour by yourself and then for 0.5 hours with your friend and find the solution. There is no other better way to clarify your concepts.",
	"introduction_key3": "For all those solutions which don't have a video, try to create a video for those solutions. By this, you will also learn how to discuss and talk about the concepts and this will be very helpful during the interviews. You can make the videos and <span style=\"\">upload</span> them, and together with the links, you can share them as <span style=\"color: #eb9371; background-color: rgba(39, 41, 43, 0.83); box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px rgba(22, 9, 1, 0.6); border-radius: 2px; padding: 2px\">comments</span> below the questions."

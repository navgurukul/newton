## How to Use

### Conversation Cards
This course has a section which contains all the topics that volunteers can have a dialogue with the students on. These topics are in the form of a 'Conversation Card' which is open for both the students and the volunteers. This Conversation Card includes the name of the topic, some sub-topics and questions, and some informative resources to read up. The volunteers can choose to use the cards as a guideline for the conversation.

Here is a sample.

```ngMeta

- Inflation
- Risk-return

### Process
* Every volunteer will be connected to one student and a call will be scheduled according as per mutual convenience.
* The dialogue can occur in person, over voice or video call.
* The student will write a medium post based on the conversation. This is important to consolidate and document the learning. It will be helpful to look back and also build on for the next dialogue.

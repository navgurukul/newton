## INTRODUCTION

Samvaad is the mentorship-through-dialogue model for NavGurukul students. Volunteers will engage in weekly dialogue where they will discuss about a pre decided topic with students. They can have a 30 - 45 minute long session with the students and discuss extensively about the given topic. The idea is to offer larger exposure to students by helping them to engage them in one-on-one sessions. Some of the examples of the topics would be resume writing, understanding personal finance, gender sensitization, exposure in contemporary issues like politics or religion and so on.

### How will it work?

Once you sign up, a call will be scheduled with one of the students at the preferred time and a topic will be decided. Students will read up about the topic prior to the call. After the call, the students will write a medium post about what was discussed on the call.

This is an opportunity to drive change through dialogue with students who are always eager to learn and explore.

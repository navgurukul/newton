<h2>What is Java?</h2></br>
Java is a programming language that produces software for multiple platforms. When a programmer writes a Java application, the compiled code (known as bytecode) runs on most operating systems (OS), including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Java derives much of its syntax from the C and C++ programming languages.

*EXTRA TRIVIA* (Ye nahi bhi yaad ho toh bhi chalega)
- Java was developed in the mid-1990s by James A. Gosling, a former computer scientist with Sun Microsystems :)

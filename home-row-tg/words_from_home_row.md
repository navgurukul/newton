## Words from keys present in the Home Row

Well done! You have completed all the key drills in the Home Row Chapter. It is time to test your muscle memory by typing words that we use in the everyday life from the Home Row. Remember, use your index finger of both of your hands to feel the bump on the key and type the key with the assigned finger only. Now that you are habituated to the home row, you must look at the screen and not at the keyboard while typing the words.

All Set! Type on then! Do your best

# Changing Individual Pixels
The color of an individual pixel can be retrieved or set with the getpixel() and putpixel() methods. These methods both take a tuple representing the x- and y-coordinates of the pixel. The putpixel() method also takes an additional tuple argument for the color of the pixel. This color argument is a four-integer RGBA tuple or a three-integer RGB tuple. Enter the following into the interactive shell:

```python
❶ >>> im = Image.new('RGBA', (100, 100))
❷ >>> im.getpixel((0, 0))
```
   (0, 0, 0, 0)
```python
❸ >>> for x in range(100):
```
           for y in range(50):
❹             im.putpixel((x, y), (210, 210, 210))
```python
   >>> from PIL import ImageColor
❺ >>> for x in range(100):
           for y in range(50, 100):
```
❻             im.putpixel((x, y), ImageColor.getcolor('darkgray', 'RGBA'))
```python
   >>> im.getpixel((0, 0))
```
   (210, 210, 210, 255)
```python
   >>> im.getpixel((0, 50))
```
   (169, 169, 169, 255)
```python
   >>> im.save('putPixel.png')
```
At ❶ we make a new image that is a 100×100 transparent square. Calling getpixel() on some coordinates in this image returns (0, 0, 0, 0) because the image is transparent ❷. To color pixels in this image, we can use nested for loops to go through all the pixels in the top half of the image ❸ and color each pixel using putpixel() ❹. Here we pass putpixel() the RGB tuple (210, 210, 210), a light gray.

Say we want to color the bottom half of the image dark gray but don’t know the RGB tuple for dark gray. The putpixel() method doesn’t accept a standard color name like 'darkgray', so you have to use ImageColor.getcolor() to get a color tuple from 'darkgray'. Loop through the pixels in the bottom half of the image ❺ and pass putpixel() the return value of ImageColor.getcolor() ❻, and you should now have an image that is light gray in its top half and dark gray in the bottom half, as shown in Figure 17-10. You can call getpixel() on some coordinates to confirm that the color at any given pixel is what you expect. Finally, save the image to putPixel.png.

Of course, drawing one pixel at a time onto an image isn’t very convenient. If you need to draw shapes, use the ImageDraw functions explained later in this chapter.

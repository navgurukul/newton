You may want to use print() calls instead, but don’t give in to this temptation! Once you’re done debugging, you’ll end up spending a lot of time removing print() calls from your `code` for each log message. You might even accidentally remove some print() calls that were being used for nonlog messages. The nice thing about log messages is that you’re free to fill your program with as many as you like, and you can always disable them later by adding a single logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL) call. Unlike print(), the logging module makes it easy to switch between showing and hiding log messages.\n",

But after developing your program some more, you may be interested only in `errors`. In that case, you can set basicConfig()’s level argument to logging.`ERROR`. This will show only `ERROR` and CRITICAL messages and skip the DEBUG, INFO, and WARNING messages.\n"

PDFs can have a user password (allowing you to view the PDF) and an owner password (allowing you to set permissions for printing, commenting, extracting text, and other features). The user password and owner password are the first and second arguments to encrypt(), respectively. If only one `string` argument is passed to encrypt(), it will be used for both passwords.\n",

We encrypted the Pdf`File`Writer with the password swordfish, opened a new PDF called encryptedminutes.pdf, and wrote the contents of the Pdf`File`Writer to the new PDF. Before anyone can view encryptedminutes.pdf, they’ll have to enter this password. You may want to delete the original, unencrypted meetingminutes.pdf `file` after ensuring its copy was correctly encrypted.\n"

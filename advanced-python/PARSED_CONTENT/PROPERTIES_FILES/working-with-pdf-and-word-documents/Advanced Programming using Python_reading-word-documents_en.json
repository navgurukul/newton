This will return a Document object, which has a paragraphs attribute that is a list of Paragraph objects. When we call len() on doc.paragraphs, it returns 7, which tells us that there are seven Paragraph objects in this document ❷. Each of these Paragraph objects has a text attribute that contains a `string` of the text in that paragraph (without the style information). Here, the first text attribute contains 'DocumentTitle' ❸, and the second contains 'A plain paragraph with some bold and some italic' ❹.\n",

Run objects also have a text attribute, containing just the text in that particular run. Let’s look at the text attributes in the second Paragraph object, 'A plain paragraph with some bold and some italic'. Calling len() on this Paragraph object tells us that there are four Run objects ❺. The first run object contains 'A plain paragraph with some ' ❻. Then, the text change to a bold style, so 'bold' starts a new Run object ❼. The text returns to an unbolded style after that, which results in a third Run object, ' and some ' ❽. Finally, the fourth and last Run object contains 'italic' in an italic style ➒.\n",

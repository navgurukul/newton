Before deleting the original `file`, have the program attempt to read and decrypt the `file` to ensure that it was encrypted correctly.\nThen, write a program that finds all encrypted PDFs in a folder (and its subfolders) and creates a decrypted copy of the PDF using a provided password. If the password is incorrect, the program should print a message to the user and continue to the next PDF.\n",

Mustard\nAl Sweigart\nRobocop\nWrite a program that would generate a Word document with custom invitations that look like Figure 13-11.\nSince `Python`-Docx can use only those styles that already exist in the Word document, you will have to first add these styles to a blank Word `file` and then open that `file` with `Python`-Docx. There should be one invitation per page in the resulting Word document, so call add_break() to add a page break after the last paragraph of each invitation. This way, you will need to open only one Word document to print all of the invitations at once.\n",

Trying to guess your forgotten password is quite a boring task. Instead you can write a program that will decrypt the PDF by trying every possible English word until it finds one that works. This is called a brute-force password attack. Download the text `file` dictionary.txt from <span><a href=\"http://nostarch.com/automatestuff/\">http://nostarch.com/automatestuff/</a></span>. This dictionary `file` contains over 44,000 English words with one word per line.\n",
	"practice-projects_key11": "Using the `file`-reading skills you learned in Chapter 8, create a list of word `strings` by reading this `file`. Then `loop` over each word in this list, passing it to the decrypt() method. If this method returns the `integer` 0, the password was wrong and your program should continue to the next password. If decrypt() returns 1, then your program should break out of the `loop` and print the hacked password. You should try both the uppercase and lower-case form of each word. (On my laptop, going through all 88,000 uppercase and lowercase words from the dictionary `file` takes a couple of minutes. This is why you shouldn’t use a simple English word for your passwords.)\n"

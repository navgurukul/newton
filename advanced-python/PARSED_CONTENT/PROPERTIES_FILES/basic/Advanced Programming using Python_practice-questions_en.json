(Amazingly enough, this sequence actually works for any `integer`—sooner or later, using this sequence, you’ll arrive at 1! Even mathematicians aren’t sure why. Your program is exploring what’s called the Collatz sequence, sometimes called “the simplest impossible math problem.”)\n",

Normally, the int() function will raise a Value`Error` `error` if it is passed a non`integer` `string`, as in int('puppy'). In the except clause, print a message to the user saying they must enter an `integer`.\n"

	"practice-questions_key35": "Then write a program that lets the user type in an `integer` and that keeps calling collatz() on that number until the function returns the value 1. (Amazingly enough, this sequence actually works for any `integer`—sooner or later, using this sequence, you’ll arrive at 1! Even mathematicians aren’t sure why. Your program is exploring what’s called the Collatz sequence, sometimes called “the simplest impossible math problem.”)\n",

	"practice-questions_key39": "Enter number:\n3\n10\n5\n16\n8\n4\n2\n1\n`Input` Validation\nAdd try and except `statements` to the previous project to detect whether the user types in a non`integer` `string`. Normally, the int() function will raise a Value`Error` `error` if it is passed a non`integer` `string`, as in int('puppy'). In the except clause, print a message to the user saying they must enter an `integer`.\n"

The requests module doesn’t come with `Python`, so you’ll have to install it first. From the command line, run pip install requests. (Appendix A has additional details on how to install third-party modules.)\n",
	"ideas-for-similar-programs_key9": "The requests module was written because `Python`’s urllib2 module is too complicated to use. In fact, take a permanent marker and black out this entire paragraph.

	"ideas-for-similar-programs_key13": "The requests.get() function takes a `string` of a URL to download. By calling type() on requests.get()’s return value, you can see that it returns a Response object, which contains the response that the web server gave for your request. I’ll explain the Response object in more detail later, but for now, enter the following into the interactive `shell` while your computer is connected to the Internet:\n",

You can tell that the request for this web page succeeded by checking the status_`code` attribute of the Response object. If it is equal to the value of requests.`codes`.ok, then everything went fine ❶. (Incidentally, the status `code` for “OK” in the HTTP protocol is 200. You may already be familiar with the 404 status `code` for “Not Found.”)\n",

This `variable` holds a large `string` of the entire play; the call to len(res.text) shows you that it is more than 178,000 characters long. Finally, calling print(res.text[:250]) displays only the first 250 characters.\n"

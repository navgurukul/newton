By middle-clicking a search result link (or clicking while holding CTRL), I open the first several links in a bunch of new `tabs` to read later. I search Google often enough that this workflow—opening my browser, searching for a topic, and middle-clicking several links one by one—is tedious. It would be nice if I could simply type a search term on the command line and have my computer automatically open a browser with all the top search results in new `tabs`.

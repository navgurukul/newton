	"chapter-1_key2": "The `operators` are +, -, *, and /. The values are 'hello', -88.8, and 5.\nThe `string` is 'spam'; the `variable` is spam. `Strings` always start and end with quotes.\nThe three data types introduced in this chapter are `integers`, `float`ing-point numbers, and `strings`.\nAn expression is a combination of values and `operators`. All expressions evaluate (that is, reduce) to a single value.\nAn expression evaluates to a single value. A `statement` does not.\nThe bacon `variable` is set to 20. The bacon + 1 expression does not reassign the value in bacon (that would need an assignment `statement`: bacon = bacon + 1).\nBoth expressions evaluate to the `string` 'spamspamspam'.\n`Variable` names cannot begin with a number.\nThe int(), `float`(), and str() functions will evaluate to the `integer`, `float`ing-point number, and `string` versions of the value passed to them.\nThe expression causes an `error` because 99 is an `integer`, and only `strings` can be concatenated to other `strings` with the + `operator`. The correct way is I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'.\n"

	"reading-and-writing-files_key3": "`Variables` are a fine way to store data while your program is running, but if you want your data to persist even after your program has finished, you need to `save` it to a `file`. You can think of a `file`’s contents as a single `string` value, potentially gigabytes in size. In this chapter, you will learn how to use `Python` to create, read, and `save` `files` on the hard drive.\n",
	"reading-and-writing-files_key4": "# `Files` and `File` Paths\n\n",
	"reading-and-writing-files_key5": "A `file` has two `key` properties: a `file`name (usually written as one word) and a path. The path specifies the location of a `file` on the computer. For example, there is a `file` on my Windows 7 laptop with the `file`name project.docx in the path C:\\Users\\asweigart\\Documents. The part of the `file`name after the last period is called the `file`’s extension and tells you a `file`’s type. project.docx is a Word document, and Users, asweigart, and Documents all refer to folders (also called directories). Folders can contain `files` and other folders. For example, project.docx is in the Documents folder, which is inside the asweigart folder, which is inside the Users folder. Figure 8-1 shows this folder organization.\n",

	"reading-and-writing-files_key7": "The C:\\ part of the path is the root folder, which contains all other folders. On Windows, the root folder is named C:\\ and is also called the C: drive. On OS X and Linux, the root folder is /. In this book, I’ll be using the Windows-style root folder, C:\\. If you are entering the interactive `shell` examples on OS X or Linux, enter / instead.\n",
	"reading-and-writing-files_key8": "Additional volumes, such as a DVD drive or USB thumb drive, will appear differently on different operating systems. On Windows, they appear as new, lettered root drives, such as D:\\ or E:\\. On OS X, they appear as new folders under the /Volumes folder. On Linux, they appear as new folders under the /mnt (“mount”) folder. Also note that while folder names and `file`names are not case sensitive on Windows and OS X, they are case sensitive on Linux.\n",

	"reading-and-writing-files_key10": "On Windows, paths are written using backslashes (\\) as the separator between folder names. OS X and Linux, however, use the forward slash (/) as their path separator. If you want your programs to work on all operating systems, you will have to write your `Python` scripts to handle both cases.\n",
	"reading-and-writing-files_key11": "Fortunately, this is simple to do with the os.path.join() function. If you pass it the `string` values of individual `file` and folder names in your path, os.path.join() will return a `string` with a `file` path using the correct path separators. Enter the following into the interactive `shell`:\n",
	"reading-and-writing-files_key12": "I’m running these interactive `shell` examples on Windows, so os.path.join('usr', 'bin', 'spam') returned 'usr\\\\bin\\\\spam'.

If I had called this function on OS X or Linux, the `string` would have been 'usr/bin/spam'.\n",
	"reading-and-writing-files_key13": "The os.path.join() function is helpful if you need to create `strings` for `file`names. These `strings` will be passed to several of the `file`-related functions introduced in this chapter. For example, the following example joins names from a list of `file`names to the end of a folder’s name:\n",

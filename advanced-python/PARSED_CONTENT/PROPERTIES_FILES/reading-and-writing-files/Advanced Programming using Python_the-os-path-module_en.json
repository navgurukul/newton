	"the-os-path-module_key2": "The os.path module contains many helpful functions related to `file`names and `file` paths. For instance, you’ve already used os.path.join() to build paths in a way that will work on any operating system. Since os.path is a module inside the os module, you can import it by simply running import os. Whenever your programs need to work with `files`, folders, or `file` paths, you can refer to the short examples in this section. The full documentation for the os.path module is on the `Python` website at<span><a href=\" http://docs.`python`.org/3/library/os.path.html.\"> http://docs.`python`.org/3/library/os.path.html.</a></span>\n",
	"the-os-path-module_key3": "Note\nMost of the examples that follow in this section will require the os module, so remember to import it at the beginning of any script you write and any time you restart IDLE. Otherwise, you’ll get a Name`Error`: name 'os' is not defined `error` message.\n",

	"the-os-path-module_key5": "The os.path module provides functions for returning the absolute path of a relative path and for checking whether a given path is an absolute path.\n",
	"the-os-path-module_key6": "Calling os.path.abspath(path) will return a `string` of the absolute path of the argument. This is an easy way to convert a relative path into an absolute one.\n",
	"the-os-path-module_key7": "Calling os.path.isabs(path) will return `True` if the argument is an absolute path and `False` if it is a relative path.\n",
	"the-os-path-module_key8": "Calling os.path.relpath(path, start) will return a `string` of a relative path from the start path to path. If start is not provided, the current working directory is used as the start path.\n",

	"the-os-path-module_key10": "Since C:\\`Python3`4 was the working directory when os.path.abspath() was called, the “single-dot” folder represents the absolute path 'C:\\\\`Python3`4'.\n",
	"the-os-path-module_key11": "Note\nSince your system probably has different `files` and folders on it than mine, you won’t be able to follow every example in this chapter exactly. Still, try to follow along using folders that exist on your computer.\n",

	"the-os-path-module_key13": "Calling os.path.dirname(path) will return a `string` of everything that comes before the last slash in the path argument. Calling os.path.basename(path) will return a `string` of everything that comes after the last slash in the path argument. The dir name and base name of a path are outlined in Figure\n",

	"the-os-path-module_key18": "Also, note that os.path.split() does not take a `file` path and return a list of `strings` of each folder. For that, use the split() `string` method and split on the `string` in os.sep. Recall from earlier that the os.sep `variable` is set to the correct folder-separating slash for the computer running the program.\n",

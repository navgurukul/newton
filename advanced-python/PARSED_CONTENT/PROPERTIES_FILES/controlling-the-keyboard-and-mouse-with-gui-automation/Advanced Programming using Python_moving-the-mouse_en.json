The pyautogui.moveTo() function will instantly move the mouse cursor to a specified position on the screen. `Integer` values for the x- and y-coordinates make up the function’s first and second arguments, respectively. An optional duration `integer` or `float` `key`word argument specifies the number of seconds it should take to move the mouse to the destination.

Each movement takes a quarter of a second, as specified by the duration=0.25 `key`word argument.

On Windows and Linux, the logout hot`key` is CTRL-ALT-DEL. On OS X, it is -SHIFT-OPTION-Q.

To do this, set the pyautogui.PAUSE `variable` to the number of seconds you want it to pause. For example, after setting pyautogui.PAUSE = 1.5, every PyAutoGUI function call will wait one and a half seconds after performing its action. Non-PyAutoGUI instructions will not have this pause.\n",

Either way, the fail-safe feature will stop the program if you quickly move the mouse as far up and left as you can. You can disable this feature by setting pyautogui.FAILSAFE = `False`.

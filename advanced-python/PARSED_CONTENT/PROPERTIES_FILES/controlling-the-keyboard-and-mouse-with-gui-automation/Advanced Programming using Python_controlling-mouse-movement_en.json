	"controlling-mouse-movement_key3": "The mouse functions of PyAutoGUI use x- and y-coordinates. Figure 18-1 shows the coordinate system for the computer screen; it’s similar to the coordinate system used for images, discussed in Chapter 17. The origin, where x and y are both zero, is at the upper-left corner of the screen. The x-coordinates increase going to the right, and the y-coordinates increase going down. All coordinates are positive `integers`; there are no negative coordinates.\n",

You can store the width and height from pyautogui.size() in `variables` like width and height for better readability in your programs.\n"

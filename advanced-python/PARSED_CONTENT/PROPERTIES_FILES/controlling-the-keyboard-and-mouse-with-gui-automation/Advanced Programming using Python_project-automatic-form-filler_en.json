Say you have a huge amount of data in a spreadsheet, and you have to tediously retype it into some other `application`’s form interface—with no intern to do it for you. Although some `applications` will have an Import feature that will allow you to `upload` a spreadsheet with the information, sometimes it seems that there is no other way than mindlessly clicking and typing for hours on end. You’ve come this far in this book; you know that of course there’s another way.\n",

The mouseNow.py script in Project: “Where Is the Mouse Right Now?” can help you figure out specific mouse coordinates. You need to know only the coordinates of the first text field. After clicking the first field, you can just press `TAB` to move focus to the next field. This will `save` you from having to figure out the x- and y-coordinates to click for every field.\n",

	"project-automatic-form-filler_key84": "GUI automation with the pyautogui module allows you to interact with `applications` on your computer by controlling the mouse and `key`board. While this approach is flexible enough to do anything that a human user can do, the downside is that these programs are fairly blind to what they are clicking or typing. When writing GUI automation programs, try to ensure that they will crash quickly if they’re given bad instructions. Crashing is annoying, but it’s much better than the program continuing in `error`.\n",

The pyautogui module can also check the colors on the screen, which can provide your GUI automation program with enough of an idea of the screen contents to know whether it has gotten offtrack. You can even give PyAutoGUI a screen-shot and let it figure out the coordinates of the area you want to click.\n",
	"project-automatic-form-filler_key86": "You can combine all of these PyAutoGUI features to automate any mindlessly repetitive task on your computer. In fact, it can be downright hypnotic to watch the mouse cursor move on its own and see text appear on the screen automatically. Why not spend the time you `save`d by sitting back and watching your program do all your work for you? There’s a certain satisfaction that comes from seeing how your cleverness has `save`d you from the boring stuff.\n"

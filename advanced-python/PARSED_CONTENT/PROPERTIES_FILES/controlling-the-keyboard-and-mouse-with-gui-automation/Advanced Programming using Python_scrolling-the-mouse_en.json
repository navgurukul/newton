	"scrolling-the-mouse_key2": "The final PyAutoGUI mouse function is scroll(), which you pass an `integer` argument for how many units you want to scroll the mouse up or down. The size of a unit varies for each operating system and `application`, so you’ll have to experiment to see exactly how far it scrolls in your particular situation. The scrolling takes place at the mouse cursor’s current position. Passing a positive `integer` scrolls up, and passing a negative `integer` scrolls down. Run the following in IDLE’s interactive `shell` while the mouse cursor is over the IDLE window:\n",
	"scrolling-the-mouse_key3": "You’ll see IDLE briefly scroll upward—and then go back down. The downward scrolling happens because IDLE automatically scrolls down to the bottom after executing an instruction. Enter this `code` instead:\n",
	"scrolling-the-mouse_key4": "This imports pyperclip and sets up an empty `string`, numbers. The `code` then `loops` through 200 numbers and adds each number to numbers, along with a newline. After pyperclip.copy(numbers), the clipboard will be loaded with 200 lines of numbers. Open a new `file` `editor` window and paste the text into it. This will give you a large text window to try scrolling in. Enter the following `code` into the interactive `shell`:\n",
	"scrolling-the-mouse_key5": "On the second line, you enter two commands separated by a semicolon, which tells `Python` to run the commands as if they were on separate lines. The only difference is that the interactive `shell` won’t prompt you for `input` between the two instructions. This is important for this example because we want to the call to pyautogui.scroll() to happen automatically after the wait. (Note that while putting two commands on one line can be useful in the interactive `shell`, you should still have each instruction on a separate line in your programs.)\n",
	"scrolling-the-mouse_key6": "After pressing ENTER to run the `code`, you will have five seconds to click the `file` `editor` window to put it in focus. Once the pause is over, the pyautogui.scroll() call will cause the `file` `editor` window to scroll up after the five-second delay.\n"

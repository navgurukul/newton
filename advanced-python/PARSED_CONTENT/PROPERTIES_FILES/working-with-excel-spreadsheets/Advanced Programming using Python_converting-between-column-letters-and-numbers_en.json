The function column_index_`string`() does the reverse: You pass it the letter name of a column, and it tells you what number that column is. You don’t need to have a workbook loaded to use these functions. If you want, you can load a workbook, get a Worksheet object, and call a Worksheet object method like max_column to get an `integer`.

The columns attribute also gives you a tuple of tuples, with each of the inner tuples containing the Cell objects in a particular column.

Figure 17-3 is the image that will be used for all the interactive `shell` examples in this chapter. You can download it from <span><a href=\"http://nostarch.com/automatestuff/\">http://nostarch.com/automatestuff/</a></span>.\n",

	"manipulating-images-with-pillow_key5": "To load the image, you import the Image module from Pillow and call Image.open(), passing it the image’s `file`name. You can then store the loaded image in a `variable` like CatIm. The module name of Pillow is PIL to make it backward compatible with an older module called `Python` Imaging Library, which is why you must run from PIL import Image instead of from Pillow import Image. Because of the way Pillow’s creators set up the pillow module, you must use the from PIL import Image form of import `statement`, rather than simply import PIL.\n",

	"manipulating-images-with-pillow_key7": "The Image.open() function returns a value of the Image object data type, which is how Pillow represents an image as a `Python` value. You can load an Image object from an image `file` (of any format) by passing the Image.open() function a `string` of the `file`name. Any changes you make to the Image object can be `save`d to an image `file` (also of any format) with the `save`() method. All the rotations, resizing, cropping, drawing, and other image manipulations will be done through method calls on this Image object.\n",
	"manipulating-images-with-pillow_key8": "To shorten the examples in this chapter, I’ll assume you’ve imported Pillow’s Image module and that you have the Zophie image stored in a `variable` named catIm. Be sure that the zophie.png `file` is in the current working directory so that the Image.open() function can find it. Otherwise, you will also have to specify the full absolute path in the `string` argument to Image.open().\n"

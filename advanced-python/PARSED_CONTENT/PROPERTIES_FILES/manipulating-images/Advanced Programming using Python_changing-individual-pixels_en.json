These methods both take a tuple representing the x- and y-coordinates of the pixel. The putpixel() method also takes an additional tuple argument for the color of the pixel.

To color pixels in this image, we can use nested for `loops` to go through all the pixels in the top half of the image ❸ and color each pixel using putpixel() ❹.

The putpixel() method doesn’t accept a standard color name like 'darkgray', so you have to use ImageColor.getcolor() to get a color tuple from 'darkgray'. `Loop` through the pixels in the bottom half of the image ❺ and pass putpixel() the return value of ImageColor.getcolor() ❻, and you should now have an image that is light gray in its top half and dark gray in the bottom half, as shown in Figure 17-10. You can call getpixel() on some coordinates to confirm that the color at any given pixel is what you expect. Finally, `save` the image to putPixel.png.\n",

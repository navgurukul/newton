Now that you have an Image object stored in catCopyIm, you can modify catCopyIm as you like and `save` it to a new `file`name, leaving zophie.png untouched.

This creates an Image object representing a 230×215 crop, which we store in faceIm. Now we can paste faceIm onto catCopyIm. The paste() method takes two arguments: a “source” Image object and a tuple of the x- and y-coordinates where you want to paste the top-left corner of the source Image object onto the main Image object. Here we call paste() twice on catCopyIm, passing (0, 0) the first time and (400, 500) the second time. This pastes faceIm onto catCopyIm twice: once with the top-left corner of faceIm at (0, 0) on catCopyIm, and once with the top-left corner of faceIm at (400, 500). Finally, we `save` the modified catCopyIm to pasted.png. The pasted.png image looks like Figure 17-5.\n",

The inner for `loop`’s top `variable` start at 0 and increases by faceImHeight(215) ❸. These nested for `loops` produce values for left and top to paste a grid of faceIm images over the catCopyTwo Image object, as in Figure 17-6.

If the image you want to paste has transparent pixels, pass the Image object as the third argument so that a solid rectangle isn’t pasted. This third argument is the “mask” Image object. A mask is an Image object where the alpha value is significant, but the red, green, and blue values are ignored. The mask tells the paste() function which pixels it should copy and which it should leave transparent. Advanced usage of masks is beyond this book, but if you want to paste an image that has transparent pixels, pass the Image object again as the third argument.\n"

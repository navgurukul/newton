	"practice-projects_key5": "Another small issue is that the program modifies PNG and JPEG `files` only if their `file` extensions are set in lowercase. For example, it will process zophie.png but not zophie.PNG. Change the `code` so that the `file` extension check is case insensitive.\n",

	"practice-projects_key7": "Finally, the logo added to the bottom-right corner is meant to be just a small mark, but if the image is about the same size as the logo itself, the result will look like Figure 17-16. Modify resizeAndAddLogo.py so that the image must be at least twice the width and height of the logo image before the logo is pasted. Other wise, it should skip adding the logo.\n"

the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key2=The startswith() and endswith() String Methods
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key3=The startswith() and endswith() methods return True if the string value they are called on begins or ends (respectively) with the string passed to the method; otherwise, they return False. Enter the following into the interactive shell:
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key4=These methods are useful alternatives to the == equals operator if you need to check only whether the first or last part of the string, rather than the whole thing, is equal to another string.
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key5=The join() and split() String Methods
The join() method is useful when you have a list of strings that need to be joined together into a single string value. The join() method is called on a string, gets passed a list of strings, and returns a string. The returned string is the concatenation of each string in the passed-in list. For example, enter the following into the interactive shell:
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key6=Notice that the string join() calls on is inserted between each string of the list argument. For example, when join(['cats', 'rats', 'bats']) is called on the ', ' string, the returned string is ‘cats, rats, bats’.
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key7=Remember that join() is called on a string value and is passed a list value. (It’s easy to accidentally call it the other way around.) The split() method does the opposite: It’s called on a string value and returns a list of strings. Enter the following into the interactive shell:
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key8=By default, the string 'My name is Simon' is split wherever whitespace characters such as the space, tab, or newline characters are found. These whitespace characters are not included in the strings in the returned list. You can pass a delimiter string to the split() method to specify a different string to split upon. For example, enter the following into the interactive shell:
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key9=A common use of split() is to split a multiline string along the newline characters. Enter the following into the interactive shell:
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key10=Passing split() the argument '\n' lets us split the multiline string stored in spam along the newlines and return a list in which each item corresponds to one line of the string.
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key11=Justifying Text with rjust(), ljust(), and center()
The rjust() and ljust() string methods return a padded version of the string they are called on, with spaces inserted to justify the text. The first argument to both methods is an integer length for the justified string. Enter the following into the interactive shell:
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key12='Hello'.rjust(10) says that we want to right-justify 'Hello' in a string of total length 10. 'Hello' is five characters, so five spaces will be added to its left, giving us a string of 10 characters with 'Hello' justified right.
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key13=An optional second argument to rjust() and ljust() will specify a fill character other than a space character. Enter the following into the interactive shell:
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key14=The center() string method works like ljust() and rjust() but centers the text rather than justifying it to the left or right. Enter the following into the interactive shell:
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key15=These methods are especially useful when you need to print tabular data that has the correct spacing. Open a new file editor window and enter the following code, saving it as picnicTable.py:
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key16=In this program, we define a printPicnic() method that will take in a dictionary of information and use center(), ljust(), and rjust() to display that information in a neatly aligned table-like format.
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key17=The dictionary that we’ll pass to printPicnic() is picnicItems. In picnicItems, we have 4 sandwiches, 12 apples, 4 cups, and 8000 cookies. We want to organize this information into two columns, with the name of the item on the left and the quantity on the right.
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key18=To do this, we decide how wide we want the left and right columns to be. Along with our dictionary, we’ll pass these values to printPicnic().
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key19=printPicnic() takes in a dictionary, a leftWidth for the left column of a table, and a rightWidth for the right column. It prints a title, PICNIC ITEMS, centered above the table. Then, it loops through the dictionary, printing each key-value pair on a line with the key justified left and padded by periods, and the value justified right and padded by spaces.
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key20=After defining printPicnic(), we define the dictionary picnicItems and call printPicnic() twice, passing it different widths for the left and right table columns.
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key21=When you run this program, the picnic items are displayed twice. The first time the left column is 12 characters wide, and the right column is 5 characters wide. The second time they are 20 and 6 characters wide, respectively.
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key22=---PICNIC ITEMS--
sandwiches..    4
apples......   12
cups........    4

Using rjust(), ljust(), and center() lets you ensure that strings are neatly aligned, even if you aren’t sure how many characters long your strings are.
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key23=Removing Whitespace with strip(), rstrip(), and lstrip()
Sometimes you may want to strip off whitespace characters (space, tab, and newline) from the left side, right side, or both sides of a string. The strip() string method will return a new string without any whitespace characters at the beginning or end. The lstrip() and rstrip() methods will remove whitespace characters from the left and right ends, respectively. Enter the following into the interactive shell:
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key24=Optionally, a string argument will specify which characters on the ends should be stripped. Enter the following into the interactive shell:
the-startswith()-and-endswith()-string-methods_key25=Passing strip() the argument 'ampS' will tell it to strip occurences of a, m, p, and capital S from the ends of the string stored in spam. The order of the characters in the string passed to strip() does not matter: strip('ampS') will do the same thing as strip('mapS') or strip('Spam').

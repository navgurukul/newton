You can store the maximum width of each column as a list of `integers`. The print`Tab`le() function can begin with colWidths = [0] * len(`tab`leData), which will create a list containing the same number of 0 values as the number of inner lists in `tab`leData. That way, colWidths[0] can store the width of the longest `string` in `tab`leData[0], colWidths[1] can store the width of the longest `string` in `tab`leData[1], and so on. You can then find the largest value in the colWidths list to find out what `integer` width to pass to the rjust() `string` method.\n"

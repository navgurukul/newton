Texting is a great way to send yourself notifications when you’re away from your computer. If you’ve automated a boring task with a program that takes a couple of hours to run, you could have it notify you with a text when it’s finished. Or you may have a regularly scheduled program running that sometimes needs to contact you, such as a weather-checking program that texts you a reminder to pack an umbrella.\n",

	"project:-“just-text-me”-module_key15": "We communicate with each other on the Internet and over cell phone networks in dozens of different ways, but email and texting predominate. Your programs can communicate through these channels, which gives them powerful new notification features. You can even write programs running on different computers that communicate with one another directly via email, with one program sending emails with SMTP and the other retrieving them with IMAP.\n",
	"project:-“just-text-me”-module_key16": "`Python`’s smtplib provides functions for using the SMTP to send emails through your email provider’s SMTP server. Likewise, the third-party imapclient and pyzmail modules let you access IMAP servers and retrieve emails sent to you. Although IMAP is a bit more involved than SMTP, it’s also quite powerful and allows you to search for particular emails, download them, and parse them to extract the subject and body as `string` values.\n",
	"project:-“just-text-me”-module_key17": "Texting is a bit different from email, since, unlike email, more than just an Internet connection is needed to send SMS texts. Fortunately, services such as Twilio provide modules to allow you to send text messages from your programs. Once you go through an initial setup process, you’ll be able to send texts with just a couple lines of `code`.\n",
	"project:-“just-text-me”-module_key18": "With these modules in your skill set, you’ll be able to program the specific conditions under which your programs should send notifications or reminders. Now your programs will have reach far beyond the computer they’re running on!\n",

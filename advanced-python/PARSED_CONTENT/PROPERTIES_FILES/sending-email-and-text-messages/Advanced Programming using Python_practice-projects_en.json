	"practice-projects_key4": "Write a program that takes a list of people’s email addresses and a list of chores that need to be done and randomly assigns chores to people. Email each person their assigned chores. If you’re feeling ambitious, keep a record of each person’s previously assigned chores so that you can make sure the program avoids assigning anyone the same chore they did last time. For another possible feature, schedule the program to run once a week automatically.\n",
	"practice-projects_key5": "Here’s a hint: If you pass a list to the random.choice() function, it will return a randomly selected item from the list. Part of your `code` could look like this:\n",

Write a program that runs just before you wake up in the morning and checks whether it’s raining that day. If so, have the program text you a reminder to pack an umbrella before leaving the house.\n",

	"practice-projects_key10": "Write a program that scans through your email account, finds all the unsubscribe links in all your emails, and automatically opens them in a browser. This program will have to log in to your email provider’s IMAP server and download all of your emails. You can use BeautifulSoup (covered in Chapter 11) to check for any instance where the word unsubscribe occurs within an HTML link tag.\n",
	"practice-projects_key11": "Once you have a list of these URLs, you can use webbrowser.open() to automatically open all of these links in a browser.\n",

You can then pass this script along to your friends so they can run it on their email accounts. (Just make sure your email password isn’t hard`code`d in the source `code`!)\n"

nested-dictionaries-and-lists_key2=Nested Dictionaries and Lists
nested-dictionaries-and-lists_key3=Modeling a tic-tac-toe board was fairly simple: The board needed only a single dictionary value with nine key-value pairs. As you model more complicated things, you may find you need dictionaries and lists that contain other dictionaries and lists. Lists are useful to contain an ordered series of values, and dictionaries are useful for associating keys with values. For example, here’s a program that uses a dictionary that contains other dictionaries in order to see who is bringing what to a picnic. The totalBrought() function can read this data structure and calculate the total number of an item being brought by all the guests.
nested-dictionaries-and-lists_key4=Inside the totalBrought() function, the for loop iterates over the key-value pairs in guests ❶. Inside the loop, the string of the guest’s name is assigned to k, and the dictionary of picnic items they’re bringing is assigned to v. If the item parameter exists as a key in this dictionary, it’s value (the quantity) is added to numBrought ❷. If it does not exist as a key, the get() method returns 0 to be added to numBrought.
nested-dictionaries-and-lists_key5=The output of this program looks like this:
nested-dictionaries-and-lists_key6=Number of things being brought:
nested-dictionaries-and-lists_key7=Apples 7
nested-dictionaries-and-lists_key8=Cups 3
nested-dictionaries-and-lists_key9=Cakes 0
nested-dictionaries-and-lists_key10=Ham Sandwiches 3
nested-dictionaries-and-lists_key11=Apple Pies     1
This may seem like such a simple thing to model that you wouldn’t need to bother with writing a program to do it. But realize that this same totalBrought() function could easily handle a dictionary that contains thousands of guests, each bringing thousands of different picnic items. Then having this information in a data structure along with the totalBrought() function would save you a lot of time!


nested-dictionaries-and-lists_key12=You can model things with data structures in whatever way you like, as long as the rest of the code in your program can work with the data model correctly. When you first begin programming, don’t worry so much about the “right” way to model data. As you gain more experience, you may come up with more efficient models, but the important thing is that the data model works for your program’s needs.
nested-dictionaries-and-lists_key13=Summary
nested-dictionaries-and-lists_key14=You learned all about dictionaries in this chapter. Lists and dictionaries are values that can contain multiple values, including other lists and dictionaries. Dictionaries are useful because you can map one item (the key) to another (the value), as opposed to lists, which simply contain a series of values in order. Values inside a dictionary are accessed using square brackets just as with lists. Instead of an integer index, dictionaries can have keys of a variety of data types: integers, floats, strings, or tuples. By organizing a program’s values into data structures, you can create representations of real-world objects. You saw an example of this with a tic-tac-toe board.

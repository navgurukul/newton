Once the program execution returns from spam, that local scope is destroyed, and there is no longer a `variable` named eggs. So when your program tries to run print(eggs), `Python` gives you an `error` saying that eggs is not defined. This makes sense if you think about it; when the program execution is in the global scope, no local scopes exist, so there canâ€™t be any local `variables`. This is why only global `variables` can be used in the global scope.\n"

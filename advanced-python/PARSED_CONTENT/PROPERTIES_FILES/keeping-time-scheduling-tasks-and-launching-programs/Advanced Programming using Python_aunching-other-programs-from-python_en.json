	"aunching-other-programs-from-python_key2": "Your `Python` program can start other programs on your computer with the Popen() function in the built-in subprocess module. (The P in the name of the Popen() function stands for process.) If you have multiple instances of an `application` open, each of those instances is a separate process of the same program. For example, if you open multiple windows of your web browser at the same time, each of those windows is a different process of the web browser program. See Figure 15-1 for an example of multiple calculator processes open at once.\n",
	"aunching-other-programs-from-python_key3": "Every process can have multiple threads. Unlike threads, a process cannot directly read and write another process’s `variables`. If you think of a multithreaded program as having multiple fingers following source `code`, then having multiple processes of the same program open is like having a friend with a separate copy of the program’s source `code`. You are both independently executing the same program.\n",
	"aunching-other-programs-from-python_key4": "If you want to start an external program from your `Python` script, pass the program’s `file`name to subprocess.Popen(). (On Windows, right-click the `application`’s Start menu item and select Properties to view the `application`’s `file`name. On OS X, CTRL-click the `application` and select Show Package Contents to find the path to the execu`tab`le `file`.) The Popen() function will then immediately return. Keep in mind that the launched program is not run in the same thread as your `Python` program.\n",

The poll() method will return None if the process is still running at the time poll() is called. If the program has terminated, it will return the process’s `integer` exit `code`. An exit `code` is used to indicate whether the process terminated without `errors` (an exit `code` of 0) or whether an `error` caused the process to terminate (a nonzero exit `code`—generally 1, but it may vary depending on the program).\n",
	"aunching-other-programs-from-python_key12": "The wait() method is like waiting for your friend to finish working on her `code` before you keep working on yours. The wait() method will block until the launched process has terminated. This is helpful if you want your program to pause until the user finishes with the other program. The return value of wait() is the process’s `integer` exit `code`.\n",

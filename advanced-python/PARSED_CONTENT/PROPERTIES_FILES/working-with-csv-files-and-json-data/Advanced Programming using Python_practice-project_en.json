Using the openpyxl module from Chapter 12, write a program that reads all the Excel `files` in the current working directory and `outputs` them as CSV `files`.\n",
	"practice-project_key4": "A single Excel `file` might contain multiple sheets; you’ll have to create one CSV `file` per sheet. The `file`names of the CSV `files` should be <excel `file`name>_<sheet title>.csv, where <excel `file`name> is the `file`name of the Excel `file` without the `file` extension (for example, 'spam_data', not 'spam_data.xlsx') and <sheet title> is the `string` from the Worksheet object’s title `variable`.\nThis program will involve many nested for `loops`. The skeleton of the program will look something like this:\nfor excel`File` in os.listdir('.'):\n    # Skip non-xlsx `files`, load the workbook object.\n    for sheetName in wb.get_sheet_names():\n        # `Loop` through every sheet in the workbook.\n        sheet = wb.get_sheet_by_name(sheetName)\n        # Create the CSV `file`name from the Excel `file`name and sheet title.\n        # Create the csv.writer object for this CSV `file`.\n        # `Loop` through every row in the sheet.\n        for rowNum in range(1, sheet.get_highest_row() + 1):\n            rowData = []    # append each cell to this list\n            # `Loop` through each cell in the row.\n            for colNum in range(1, sheet.get_highest_column() + 1):\n                # Append each cell's data to rowData.\n            # Write the rowData list to the CSV `file`.\n        csv`File`.close()\nDownload the ZIP `file` excelSpreadsheets.zip from <span><a href=\"http://nostarch.com/automatestuff/\">http://nostarch.com/automatestuff/</a></span>, and unzip the spreadsheets into the same directory as your program. You can use these as the `files` to test the program on.\n"

What about a phone number formatted like 415.555.4242 or (415) 555-4242? What if the phone number had an extension, like 415-555-4242 x99? The isPhoneNumber() function would fail to validate them. You could add yet more `code` for these additional patterns, but there is an easier way.\n",
	"finding-patterns-of-text-with-regular-expressions_key3": "Regular expressions, called regexes for short, are descriptions for a pattern of text. For example, a \\d in a regex stands for a digit character—that is, any single numeral 0 to 9. The regex \\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d is used by `Python` to match the same text the previous isPhoneNumber() function did: a `string` of three numbers, a hyphen, three more numbers, another hyphen, and four numbers. Any other `string` would not match the \\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d \\d\\d regex.\n",
	"finding-patterns-of-text-with-regular-expressions_key4": "But regular expressions can be much more sophisticated. For example, adding a 3 in curly brackets ({3}) after a pattern is like saying, “Match this pattern three times.” So the slightly shorter regex \\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4} also matches the correct phone number format.\n",

In this example, we know that our pattern will be found in the `string`, so we know that a Match object will be returned.

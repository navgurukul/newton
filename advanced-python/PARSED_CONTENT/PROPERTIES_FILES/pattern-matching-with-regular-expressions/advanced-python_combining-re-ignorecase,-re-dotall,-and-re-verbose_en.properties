combining-re-ignorecase,-re-dotall,-and-re-verbose_key2=Combining re.IGNORECASE, re.DOTALL, and re.VERBOSE
combining-re-ignorecase,-re-dotall,-and-re-verbose_key3=What if you want to use re.VERBOSE to write comments in your regular expression but also want to use re.IGNORECASE to ignore capitalization? Unfortunately, the re.compile() function takes only a single value as its second argument. You can get around this limitation by combining the re.IGNORECASE, re.DOTALL, and re.VERBOSE variables using the pipe character (|), which in this context is known as the bitwise or operator.
combining-re-ignorecase,-re-dotall,-and-re-verbose_key4=So if you want a regular expression that’s case-insensitive and includes newlines to match the dot character, you would form your re.compile() call like this:
combining-re-ignorecase,-re-dotall,-and-re-verbose_key5=All three options for the second argument will look like this:
combining-re-ignorecase,-re-dotall,-and-re-verbose_key6=This syntax is a little old-fashioned and originates from early versions of Python. The details of the bitwise operators are beyond the scope of this book, but check out the resources at

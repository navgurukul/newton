You can put all of these into a character class: [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-].\nThe domain and username are separated by an @ symbol ❷. The domain name ❸ has a slightly less permissive character class with only letters, numbers, periods, and hyphens: [a-zA-Z0-9.-]. And last will be the “dot-com” part (technically known as the top-level domain), which can really be dot-anything. This is between two and four characters.\nThe format for email addresses has a lot of weird rules. This regular expression won’t match every possible valid email address, but it’ll match almost any typical email address you’ll encounter.\n#Step 3: Find All Matches in the Clipboard Text\nNow that you have specified the regular expressions for phone numbers and email addresses, you can let `Python`’s re module do the hard work of finding all the matches on the clipboard. The pyperclip.paste() function will get a `string` value of the text on the clipboard, and the findall() regex method will return a list of tuples.\nMake your program look like the following:\n",

It starts off as an empty list, and a couple for `loops`. For the email addresses, you append group 0 of each match ❸. For the matched phone numbers, you don’t want to just append group 0. While the program detects phone numbers in several formats, you want the phone number appended to be in a single, standard format. The phoneNum `variable` contains a `string` built from groups 1, 3, 5, and 8 of the matched text ❷. (These groups are the area `code`, first three digits, last four digits, and extension.)\n",

The pyperclip.copy() function takes only a single `string` value, not a list of `strings`, so you call the join() method on matches.\nTo make it easier to see that the program is working, let’s print any matches you find to the `terminal`. And if no phone numbers or email addresses were found, the program should tell the user this.\nMake your program look like the following:\n"

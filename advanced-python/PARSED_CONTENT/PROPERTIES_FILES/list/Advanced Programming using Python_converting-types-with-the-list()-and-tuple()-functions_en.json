When you later change the value in spam to 100, this doesn’t affect the value in cheese. This is because spam and cheese are different `variables` that store different values.\n",
	"converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key8": "But lists don’t work this way. When you assign a list to a `variable`, you are actually assigning a list reference to the `variable`. A reference is a value that points to some bit of data, and a list reference is a value that points to a list. Here is some `code` that will make this distinction easier to understand. Enter this into the interactive `shell`:\n",

But the next line ❷ copies only the list reference in spam to cheese, not the list value itself. This means the values stored in spam and cheese now both refer to the same list. There is only one underlying list because the list itself was never actually copied. So when you modify the first element of cheese ❸, you are modifying the same list that spam refers to.\n",
	"converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key11": "Remember that `variables` are like boxes that contain values. The previous figures in this chapter show that lists in boxes aren’t exactly accurate because list `variables` don’t actually contain lists—they contain references to lists. (These references will have ID numbers that `Python` uses internally, but you can ignore them.) Using boxes as a metaphor for `variables`, Figure 4-4 shows what happens when a list is assigned to the spam `variable`.\n",

But for `strings` and `integer` values, `variables` simply contain the `string` or `integer` value. `Python` uses references whenever `variables` must store values of mu`tab`le data types, such as lists or dictionaries.

	"converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key20": "References are particularly important for understanding how arguments get passed to functions. When a function is called, the values of the arguments are copied to the parameter `variables`. For lists (and dictionaries, which I’ll describe in the next chapter), this means a copy of the reference is used for the parameter. To see the consequences of this, open a new `file` `editor` window, enter the following `code`, and `save` it as passingReference.py:\n",

For this, `Python` provides a module named copy that provides both the copy() and deepcopy() functions. The first of these, copy.copy(), can be used to make a duplicate copy of a mu`tab`le value like a list or dictionary, not just a copy of a reference. Enter the following into the interactive `shell`:\n",

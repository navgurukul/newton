docx.Document('demo.docx')

A document contains multiple paragraphs. A paragraph begins on a new line and contains multiple runs. Runs are contiguous groups of characters within a paragraph.

Use doc.paragraphs.

A Run object has these variables (not a Paragraph).

True always makes the Run object bolded and False makes it always not bolded, no matter what the style’s bold setting is. None will make the Run object just use the style’s bold setting.

Call the docx.Document() function.

doc.add_paragraph('Hello there!')

The integers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4

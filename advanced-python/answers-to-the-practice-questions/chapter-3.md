# Chapter 3
Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.

The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when the function is defined.

The def statement defines (that is, creates) a function.

A function consists of the def statement and the code in its def clause.

A function call is what moves the program execution into the function, and the function call evaluates to the function’s return value.

There is one global scope, and a local scope is created whenever a function is called.

When a function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables in it are forgotten.

A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value can be used as part of an expression.

If there is no return statement for a function, its return value is None.

A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable.

The data type of None is NoneType.

That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic. (This isn’t a real Python module, by the way.)

This function can be called with spam.bacon().

Place the line of code that might cause an error in a try clause.

The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try clause.

The code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause.

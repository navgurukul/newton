How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the following:

'Alice eats apples.'

'Bob pets cats.'

'Carol throws baseballs.'

'Alice throws Apples.'

'BOB EATS CATS.'

but not the following:

'Robocop eats apples.'

'ALICE THROWS FOOTBALLS.'

'Carol eats 7 cats.'

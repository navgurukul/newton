# Review of Regex Symbols
This chapter covered a lot of notation, so here’s a quick review of what you learned:

The ? matches zero or one of the preceding group.

The * matches zero or more of the preceding group.

The + matches one or more of the preceding group.

The {n} matches exactly n of the preceding group.

The {n,} matches n or more of the preceding group.

The {,m} matches 0 to m of the preceding group.

The {n,m} matches at least n and at most m of the preceding group.

{n,m}? or *? or +? performs a nongreedy match of the preceding group.
^spam means the string must begin with spam.
spam$ means the string must end with spam.
The . matches any character, except newline characters.
\d, \w, and \s match a digit, word, or space character, respectively.
\D, \W, and \S match anything except a digit, word, or space character, respectively.
[abc] matches any character between the brackets (such as a, b, or c).
[^abc] matches any character that isn’t between the brackets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
# Case-Insensitive Matching
Normally, regular expressions match text with the exact casing you specify. For example, the following regexes match completely different strings:
```python
>>> regex1 = re.compile('Robocop')
>>> regex2 = re.compile('ROBOCOP')
>>> regex3 = re.compile('robOcop')
>>> regex4 = re.compile('RobocOp')
```
But sometimes you care only about matching the letters without worrying whether they’re uppercase or lowercase. To make your regex case-insensitive, you can pass re.IGNORECASE or re.I as a second argument to re.compile(). Enter the following into the interactive shell:
```python
>>> robocop = re.compile(r'robocop', re.I)
>>> robocop.search('Robocop is part man, part machine, all cop.').group()
'Robocop'

>>> robocop.search('ROBOCOP protects the innocent.').group()
'ROBOCOP'

>>> robocop.search('Al, why does your programming book talk about robocop so much?').group()
'robocop'
```

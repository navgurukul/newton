# The keys(), values(), and items() Methods
There are three dictionary methods that will return list-like values of the dictionaryâ€™s keys, values, or both keys and values: keys(), values(), and items(). The values returned by these methods are not true lists: They cannot be modified and do not have an append() method. But these data types (dict_keys, dict_values, and dict_items, respectively) can be used in for loops. To see how these methods work, enter the following into the interactive shell:

```python
>>> spam = {'color': 'red', 'age': 42}
>>> for v in spam.values():
        print(v)

red
42
Here, a for loop iterates over each of the values in the spam dictionary. A for loop can also iterate over the keys or both keys and values:


>>> for k in spam.keys():
        print(k)

color
age
>>> for i in spam.items():
        print(i)

('color', 'red')
('age', 42)
```
Using the keys(), values(), and items() methods, a for loop can iterate over the keys, values, or key-value pairs in a dictionary, respectively. Notice that the values in the dict_items value returned by the items() method are tuples of the key and value.

If you want a true list from one of these methods, pass its list-like return value to the list() function. Enter the following into the interactive shell:

```python
>>> spam = {'color': 'red', 'age': 42}
>>> spam.keys()
dict_keys(['color', 'age'])
>>> list(spam.keys())
['color', 'age']
```
The list(spam.keys()) line takes the dict_keys value returned from keys() and passes it to list(), which then returns a list value of ['color', 'age'].

You can also use the multiple assignment trick in a for loop to assign the key and value to separate variables. Enter the following into the interactive shell:

```python
>>> spam = {'color': 'red', 'age': 42}
>>> for k, v in spam.items():
        print('Key: ' + k + ' Value: ' + str(v))

Key: age Value: 42
Key: color Value: red
```

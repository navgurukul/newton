# List to Dictionary Function for Fantasy Game Inventory
Imagine that a vanquished dragon’s loot is represented as a list of strings like this:


dragonLoot = ['gold coin', 'dagger', 'gold coin', 'gold coin', 'ruby']
Write a function named addToInventory(inventory, addedItems), where the inventory parameter is a dictionary representing the player’s inventory (like in the previous project) and the addedItems parameter is a list like dragonLoot. The addToInventory() function should return a dictionary that represents the updated inventory. Note that the addedItems list can contain multiples of the same item. Your code could look something like this:


def addToInventory(inventory, addedItems):
    # your code goes here
```python
inv = {'gold coin': 42, 'rope': 1}
dragonLoot = ['gold coin', 'dagger', 'gold coin', 'gold coin', 'ruby']
inv = addToInventory(inv, dragonLoot)
displayInventory(inv)
```
The previous program (with your displayInventory() function from the previous project) would output the following:


Inventory:
45 gold coin
1 rope
1 ruby
1 dagger

Total number of items: 48

	"For-in-loop_key4": "By for in when you are `loop`ing on an array, in the car each time its `key` (index number) will come like 0, 1 ,2 respectively. \n",
	"For-in-loop_key5": "When the first time `loop` is running the car value is 0, we said to print cars[car] means cars[0] so it prints Maruti because in the zeroth position of cars we have Maruthi.\n",
	"For-in-loop_key6": "When the second time `loop` is running, the car value is 1, we said to print cars[car] means cars[1] so it print Mercedes because in the first position of cars we have Mercedes.\n",
	"For-in-loop_key7": "When the third time `loop` is running, the car value is 2, we said to print cars[car] means cars[2] so it prints BMW because in the first position of cars we have BMW.\n",

	"For-in-loop_key11": "In the above example, we used index number to get element from list. In this cureent example we prinnted the index number only be the varibale campus, and in the campus 0, 1, 2, 3 will come respectively.\n",

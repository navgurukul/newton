	"Diff-between-while-loop-and-do-while-loop_key4": "In the above example, if you see from do while it is printed 2  because in do while first it won’t check `loop` condition and it will run `loop` for 1 time and after a while it will check the `loop` condition i> 10 means 2>10 which is `false`.  So, it will never run.\n",
	"Diff-between-while-loop-and-do-while-loop_key5": "In the while `loop` it will check the `loop` condition first. It is `false` so it won’t `execute` a block of `code` written inside that, so that’s why it won’t print anything.\n"

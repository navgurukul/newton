## Question 4

Print this pattern using Loops. 

**1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6 ..99, -100**

### Hint :

Notice that first number is `positive`, and the second number is `negative`, then again a positive and then negative number and so on should be printed. Pattern looks similar to this `Positive (+) Number`, `Negative (-) Number`, `Positive (+) Number`, `Negative (-) Number` and so on.

We can make any number negative by mutiplying it by `-1`.

#### Example :-


10 * -1 = -10
2 * -1 = 2

You can use the above `Hint` to write the program.

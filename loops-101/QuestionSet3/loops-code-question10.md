## Question 10

Make an algorithm that prints the first 100 numbers of the `fibonacci series`.

`Fibonacci series` is shown here,
**0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34**

In this series `first_number` is 0 and`second_number ` is 1. After this, the next number will be the sum of the `last two numbers`.

- Like, third_number = `first_number` + `second_number`
- `1 = 0 + 1`
- `fourth_number` = `second_number` + `third_number`
- `2 = 1 + 1`

#### Hint : 

Now, think about how you can access the `current counter` and previous counter value.

## Question 8

1. Now, we will change the previous game a little. We only checked whether the `number` given by the user is equal to the `input number` or not.

2. Now, we will also tell the user if the `number` given by the user is greater or smaller than the input number.
3. If the user gives `4` as a number then we will check if `4 is less than 5` or not so it's true then we will print "Number entered by you entered is small, try one more time ".

4. We will again take input from the user. If the user gives `7 `as a number then we will check if `7 is less than 5 or not` so it is `False` then we will print "Number entered by you entered is greater, try one more time ".
5.  If the user gives `5` as input then this `number` is equal to the `given number` then we will print "Wow you guessed the correct number".
6. User will keep on `guessing` `until` all the chances are finished.

If we will give such types of hints to the user, it will become easier for him to solve the question.

## Question 7

Now, we will make a game using loops. We will call this game a **guessing game**.

1. In this game we take any number, let us suppose this number is **`number 5`**.

2. After this we take any number as an input from the user between **`1 to 10`**. The user tries to guess this number.

3. Suppose the user gives `3`as an input. We will then check if `3` is equal to 5 or not?
4. `3 is not equal to 5` so we will ask the user for another input.
5. Now, we will check if that number is equal to 5 or not.
6. User will get **`5 chances`** to guess.

If he guessed right within the 5 chances he wins and if he guesses wrong then loses the game.

 Study about `break statement` in python.

	"introduction_key2": "This set of questions is similar to the last set of questions. Solve it in the same way.\n",
	"introduction_key3": "In this section, some questions are given. Solutions to some of the questions are given. If you want, you can see the solutions directly. But that will not at all help you. It would be better that first try that question for at least 1 hour by yourself and then for 0.5 hours with your friend and find the solution. There is no other better way to clarify your concepts.\n",
	"introduction_key4": "For all those solutions which don't have a video, try to create a video for those solutions. By this, you will also learn how to discuss and talk about the concepts and this will be very helpful during the interviews. You can make the videos and `upload` them, and together with the links, you can share them as comments below the questions.\n"

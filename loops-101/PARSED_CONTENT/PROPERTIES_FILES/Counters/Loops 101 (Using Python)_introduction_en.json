	"introduction_key2": "`Counter` is a `variable` where we assign a value and it is also a **good `variable`** which decides that our `loop` will run from where to where.\n",
	"introduction_key3": "Example :-\n",
	"introduction_key4": "`Let us understand Counter with the help of an example.`\n",
	"introduction_key5": "In the `counter` `variable` we give a number that tells that the `loop` will run from where to where. The `loop` keeps on running `until` the `loop` condition becomes `False`,\n",
	"introduction_key6": "**Now we will try to understand different parts of the example.**\n",
	"introduction_key7": "We have defined a `variable` with a `variable` name as `counter`. Now we are telling the `variable`, that we will run the `loop` from 1 to 5. The starting point of the `loop` is 1 and we will print `\"Working\"`. The `loop` will stop working when the value of the count is 6 and at that time the `loop` condition becomes `False`.\n",
	"introduction_key8": "`1<=5` condition `True` `loop` will run.\n",
	"introduction_key9": "The `loop` will increment and run till `5<=5`.\n",
	"introduction_key10": "Now, after incrementing, when the count value becomes 6 then the `6<=5` condition becomes `False` then the `loop` will stop working.\n",
	"introduction_key11": "So, this is how the `counter` works.\n"

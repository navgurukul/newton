## What is `Counter`?

`Counter` is a variable where we assign a value and it is also a **good variable** which decides that our loop will run from where to where.

#### Example :- 

```python
count=1
While count<=5:
    print("Working")
    count = count + 1
```
`Let us understand Counter with the help of an example.`


In the `counter` variable we give a number that tells that the `loop` will run from where to where. The loop keeps on running `until` the loop condition becomes `False`,



**Now we will try to understand different parts of the example.**

We have defined a variable with a variable name as `counter`. Now we are telling the variable, that we will run the loop from 1 to 5. The starting point of the loop is 1 and we will print `"Working"`. The loop will stop working when the value of the count is 6 and at that time the loop condition becomes `False`.

`1<=5` condition `True` loop will run.

The loop will increment and run till `5<=5`.

Now, after incrementing, when the count value becomes 6 then the `6<=5` condition becomes `False` then the loop will stop working.


So, this is how the `counter` works.

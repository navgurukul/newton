##  Question 6

`Prime numbers` are those numbers that are divisible by 1 or by themselves. Example:-

1.`13` is `prime` because `13` is `perfectly divisible` by `13` and `1`. It is not `perfectly divisible` by any other number.

2.`4` is not prime number because `4` is perfectly divisible by `4`, `2` and `1`.

For `prime numbers` you have to check that the number is divisible by how many numbers and you have to use `loops` also.

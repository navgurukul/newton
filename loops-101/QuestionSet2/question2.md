## Question 2

Make a program that should do the following thing from `1 to 100`.


1. Numbers that are divisible by `3`, you have to print "`Nav"`. 

2. Numbers that are divisible by `7` so that `"Gurukul"` is printed.
3. Numbers that are divisible by both `3` and `7`, print `"NavGurukul"` there.

4. If the number does not come in the above three cases then print the number only.

Your output should look like this.

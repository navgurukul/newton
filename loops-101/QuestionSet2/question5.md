## Question 5

Take an integer input in a variable named `n`. Take user input as many times as the value of `n`.

Finally, print the sum of all those numbers which you have taken as an input.

Example: If the user has put `n` value as `6`, then take input for 6 times.


Number of inputs to be taken?  6
Enter a number > 10
Enter a number > 1
Enter a number > 56
Enter a number > 89
Enter a number > 11
Enter a number > 12
Sum: 179


`n` value  is taken as an input in this line`Number of inputs to be taken?` 

`Sum 179` is written because `10+1+56+89+11+12` result into `179`.

Example: Suppose if the user has given the value of `n` as `10`, then the program will run as below, you can give the value of `n` as per your choice.

Number of inputs to be taken?' 10
Enter a number > 11
Enter a number > 7
Enter a number > 14
Enter a number > 76
Enter a number > 21
Enter a number > 34
Enter a number > 86
Enter a number > 5
Enter a number > 78
Enter a number > 64
Sum: 396


`Sum 396` is because the sum of `11+7+14+76+21+34+86+5+78+64` is `396`.

## Question 3

Make a loop that inputs 10 numbers. After taking the input prints the sum of all those numbers.

This program will run like this. Everytime  use `input()` to take the numbers as an input.


Step 1 of 10 :- Enter any number > 10
Step 2 of 10 :- Enter any number > 16
Step 3 of 10 :- Enter any number > 9
Step 4 of 10 :- Enter any number > 10
Step 5 of 10 :- Enter any number > 56
Step 6 of 10 :- Enter any number > 78
Step 7 of 10 :- Enter any number > 98
Step 8 of 10 :- Enter any number > 43
Step 9 of 10 :- Enter any number > 21
Step 10 of 10 :- Enter any number > 76

Total Sum: 417


In the final line, **Total Sum: 417** will be printed. This will be printed because `sum of **10+16+9+10+56+78+98+43+21+76**` is `417`.

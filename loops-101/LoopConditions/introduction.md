## Understanding `Loop Conditions`

@[youtube](jsUN0NV5RfQ)

Let us see this code.

```python
i = 1
while i < 100:
  print(i)
  i = i + 1
```
This code will print numbers from `1 to 99`. To better understand the code we will try to understand each line.

1. `i = 1`, here we have taken a variable named as `i` and we have put `1` value in it.
2. `while i < 100`, here we have defined a loop. By the given while condition, we mean that `loop` will run and do whatever is written inside it `till` the value of `i` is less than `100`.
3. `print(i)` line is written inside the loop. So, `till` the value of i is less than 100, this line will be printed. 
4. `i = i + 1`, this line will increase our counter. This line will also tell that how many times the loop will run.

Here, `i = i + 1` and `while i < 100` are very important statements. after watching this video that what is the exact meaning of these lines and how does the computer understands them, by this way we will be able to write the loops in a better way.

1. What does it mean to write the `i < 100` in the following loop?
```python
i = 1
while i <= 10:
  print(i)
  i = i + 1
```
2. How does the `loop` runs? Every time the code within the `loop block` is executed the condition is evaluated once again and `until` the condition is `True`, the loop keeps on running. The condition results in a `boolean` and if the `boolean` is true then the loop runs otherwise it does not run.
3. Apart from this we can also put the statement like this.
```python
i = 1
while i != 10:
  print(i)
  i = i + 1
```

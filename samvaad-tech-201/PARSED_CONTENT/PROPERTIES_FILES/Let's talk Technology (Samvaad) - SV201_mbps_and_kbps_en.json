Important: The lowercase \"b\" in Kbps and Mbps means \"bit,\" not byte.\nKbps and Mbps define measurement units for the speed engaged in data transfers. Speed is calculated in terms of bits per second. A bit is the smallest unit of data in a computer and it is implemented with the current electronic technology. Bit is actually a short term to refer to a binary digit. It can either hold 0 or 1. One represents an on state and zero represents an off state.\n",

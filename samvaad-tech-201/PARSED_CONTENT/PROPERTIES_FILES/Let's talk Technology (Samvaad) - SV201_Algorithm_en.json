	"Algorithm_key3": "An algorithm is a fancy to-do list for a computer. Algorithms take in zero or more `inputs` and give back one or more `outputs`.\n",
	"Algorithm_key4": "A recipe is a good example of an algorithm because it tells you what you need to do step by step. It takes `inputs` (ingredients) and produces an `output` (the completed dish).\n",
	"Algorithm_key5": "The words 'algorithm' and 'algorism' come from the name of a Persian mathematician called Al-Khwārizmī (Persian: خوارزمی‎‎, c. 780–850).\n",
	"Algorithm_key6": "An algorithm is a sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem, i.e., for obtaining a required `output` for any legitimate(accep`tab`le) `input` in a finite amount of time [Levitin, p. 3]. ... Indeed, algorithms are commonly expressed either in a programming language like Pascal or C++, or a pseudo`code`.\n",
	"Algorithm_key7": "To write a computer program, you have to tell the computer, step by step, exactly what you want it to do. The computer then \"`executes`\" the program, following each step mechanically, to accomplish the end goal. ... That's where computer algorithms come in. The algorithm is the basic technique used to get the job done.\n",
	"Algorithm_key8": "A good algorithm should produce the correct `outputs` for any set of legal `inputs`. A good algorithm should `execute` efficiently with the fewest number of steps as possible. A good algorithm should be designed in such a way that others will be able to understand it and modify it to specify solutions to additional problems.\n",

	"Algorithm_key10": "Precision – the steps are precisely stated(defined).\n",
	"Algorithm_key11": "Uniqueness – results of each step are uniquely definedand only depend on the `input` and the result of the precedingsteps.\n",

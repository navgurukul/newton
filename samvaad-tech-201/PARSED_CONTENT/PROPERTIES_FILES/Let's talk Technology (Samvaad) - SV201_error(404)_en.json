	"error(404)_key3": "#What is `error` 404-\nThe HTTP 404, 404 Not Found, and 404 `error` message is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standard response `code`, in computer network communications, to indicate that the client was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested.\n",
	"error(404)_key4": "The website hosting server will typically generate a \"404 Not Found\" web page when a user attempts to follow a broken or dead link; hence the 404 `error` is one of the most recognizable `errors` encountered on the World Wide Web.\n",
	"error(404)_key5": "## Khow more about `error` 404-\n\n",
	"error(404)_key6": "When communicating via HTTP, a server is required to respond to a request, such as a web browser request for a web page, with a numeric response `code` and an optional, mandatory, or disallowed (based upon the status `code`) message. In the `code` 404, the first digit indicates a client `error`, such as a mistyped Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The following two digits indicate the specific `error` encountered. HTTP's use of three-digit `codes` is similar to the use of such `codes` in earlier protocols such as FTP and NNTP.\n",
	"error(404)_key7": "At the HTTP level, a 404 response `code` is followed by a human-readable \"reason phrase\". The HTTP specification suggests the phrase \"Not Found\"[1] and many web servers by default issue an HTML page that includes both the 404 `code` and the \"Not Found\" phrase.\n",
	"error(404)_key8": "A 404 `error` is often returned when pages have been moved or deleted. In the first case, it is better to employ URL mapping or URL redirection by returning a 301 Moved Permanently response, which can be configured in most server configuration `files`, or through URL rewriting; in the second case, a 410 Gone should be returned. Because these two options require special server configuration, most websites do not make use of them.\n",
	"error(404)_key9": "404 `errors` should not be confused with DNS `errors`, which appear when the given URL refers to a server name that does not exist. A 404 `error` indicates that the server itself was found, but that the server was not able to retrieve the requested page.\n",

## mbps / kbps internet speed:
Kbps stands for "kilobits per second," while Mbps stands for "megabits per second." Because one megabit is equal to 1,000 kilobits, 1 Mbps is 1000 times faster than 1 Kbps. Important: The lowercase "b" in Kbps and Mbps means "bit," not byte.
Kbps and Mbps define measurement units for the speed engaged in data transfers. Speed is calculated in terms of bits per second. A bit is the smallest unit of data in a computer and it is implemented with the current electronic technology. Bit is actually a short term to refer to a binary digit. It can either hold 0 or 1. One represents an on state and zero represents an off state.

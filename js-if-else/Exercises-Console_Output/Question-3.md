 } else if (choice === 'rainy') {
     message = 'Rain is falling outside; \nTake a rain coat and an umbrella, and don\'t stay out for too long.'
 } else if (choice === 'snowing') {
     message = 'The snow is coming down â€” it is freezing! \nBest to stay in with a cup of hot chocolate, or go build a snowman.'
 } else if (choice === 'overcast') {
     message = 'It isn\'t raining, but the sky is grey and gloomy; \nit could turn any minute, so take a rain coat just in case.'
 } else {
   message = 'Nothing'
}

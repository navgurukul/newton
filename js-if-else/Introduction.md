name: Conditional statements
```

Think that we have decided if it rains tomorrow I will not go to play in the park, and if it does not rain then I will go to play in the park. How to write this in code.

#### Consider the following example:

```javascript
let condition = 'Raining';
if(condition == 'Raining'){
  console.log('I will not go to the park');
    }    
else{
  console.log('I will go to the park')
    }
```


### Explanation:
In this example, there are two outputs (play in the park, and not play in the park), which depends on a condition which is the rainfall.

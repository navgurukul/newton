```ngMeta
name: Else if statement
```

### Example:
```javascript
var course = "Hindi";
if (course == "English"){
    console.log("Tutorial content is there in English");
    }
else if (course == "Hindi"){
    console.log("Tutorial content is there in Hindi");
    }
else {
    console.log("I am not understanding of Language");
}

// Output : Tutorial content is there in Hindi

```

### Explanation:

if the course is equal to English, output “Tutorial content is there in English”.else if the course is equal to Hindi, output “Tutorial content is there in Hindi”.if nothing of the above condition is true, then output “I am not understanding of Languaget”


else If condition specifies a new condition if the first condition will be  false then it checks other conditions. 

#### Note

When we have many conditions to check and we want a condition to be true then we use an else-if keyword.

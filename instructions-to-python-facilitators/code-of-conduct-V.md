name: Code of Conduct for Volunteers
```


The code is a tool for understanding and upholding culturally acceptable, safe, and respectful standards across the online classroom structure. The code of conduct ensures volunteers begin with a common understanding of volunteer standards. 

This has to be maintained while conducting the online sessions over Meraki application and Google-Meet links, offline/online.

Following are some key points to be kept in mind by volunteers while conducting sessions:

- **Video Call Enablement**
    - Videos are not mandatory, using video during the class is a personal choice. Please decide based on the situation/class.
    - If you choose to use video during the call, please ensure that you are maintaining an appropriate standard of dress and personal hygiene

- **Voice and Chat interaction**
    - Please do not write any text in the chat-box which is not relevant to the class
    - Adopt correct words, usage of foul language is prohibited
    - Keeping confidential matters confidential
    - Do not engage in any abusive/bullying activity that may cause distress to another person (such as verbal abuse, physical abuse, assault, bullying, or discrimination or harassment on the grounds of gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or membership of the Traveler community)

- **Mode of Communication and Information with Students**
    - Do not ask/share personal contact details
    - Do not send/accept requests over any other social media platform eg Instagram, Facebook,  Snapchat, etc., is not recommended to ensure security and privacy.
    - Instruct students on how you will communicate with them, and how they should communicate with you for example - the students can raise their hands to ask a question or you can ask a student to respond to a query or question, behaviour, or whether they should mute their microphones (possible to enforce by using the mute all button) and turn on or off their webcam at the start of each session.
    - Do not Seek or accept any gifts, rewards, benefits, or hospitality in the course of their role

- **Online** **Classroom Etiquettes**
    - Not be affected by alcohol, drugs, or medication which will affect their abilities to carry out their duties and responsibilities while volunteering
    - Treating all the students with fairness and dignity
    - When sharing your screen, close all sensitive documents or tabs. Check your browser bookmarks and other open applications and furthermore, be aware that you are on camera
    - Meeting time and task commitments and providing sufficient notice when they will not be available so that alternative arrangements can be made
    - Raising and reporting concerns about possible wrong-doing witnessed by the volunteer in the course of the volunteer’s role
    - Ensure that content shared with students is appropriate and accessible to all, and is course-related.
    - Clarify when the live session has ended, and wait for all students to log off/leave the
    session.

- **Privacy, Compliance, Data** **Confidentiality, and Breach of Conduct**
    - Do not commit on behalf of the organization unless it is approved in writing or asked. Restrain from providing a false or misleading statement, declaration, document, record, or claim in respect of NavGurukul/Meraki
    - Students' camera’s should be off, unless it is of added value to your classes to switch them on. Students may always choose to switch them on voluntarily.
    - Inform students in advance of live sessions if they will be recorded and the only record sessions if this is of added value to your classes. Students may then choose to turn off their webcam if they do not wish to be part of the recording
    - Do not share any information which is not related to the course content
    - Do not Provide a false or misleading statement, declaration, document, record, or claim in respect of NavGurukul/Meraki

***Where a volunteer is found to be in breach of the standards outlined in this Code of Conduct or any of Meraki’s other policies and procedures, in the interest of students, this may result in the volunteer’s position being terminated***

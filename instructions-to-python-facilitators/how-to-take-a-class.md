Dear Facilitator, 

We're sure you're wondering how your first class would be, thinking hard on how you must interact with students, etc. Don't worry. We're sharing a few simple points that you can keep in mind, that shall help you in your classes. 

* Give a very warm welcome to the students into your class and assure them you'll support them in their journey of learning Python/ English or Typing *(whichever program you're here to teach for)* The students are here for a three month introductory course to Python, supported with English and Touch Typing if they're interested. 
* Introduce yourself. Tell them what you do, and share any of your beginner experiences with them in the respective field, to encourage and motivate them. 
* Make your initial classes very inspiring. Create a sense of curiosity in them. You could share videos with them, daily real life examples of its application. Show them what they can achieve once they learn any of the three programs. 

* Teach them how to [enrol to a class](https://youtu.be/Lha-WlS2Hkg) on the application. You can screenshare the application. Do this for a few classes till they understand and get accustomed to Meraki. 

* You can also state the program structure. 23 Classes for Python and 15 Classes for English. Tell them how they'll have to attend Class 1, then Class 2 and then Class 3 in an order so that they don't miss out on anything. 
* If they are stuck anywhere, they can attend any doubt class and get it solved. 
* You can show them the curriculum for [Python](https://www.merakilearn.org/course/152/exercise/3719) and [English](https://www.merakilearn.org/course/152/exercise/3720) as well.

* You must encourage them to self study through [Meraki](https://youtu.be/UN3us4vDHhc) and use the live classes as support in their learning journey. Encourage them to read more, and run their codes on [Playground](https://youtu.be/UN3us4vDHhc) on Meraki, to practice. 
* We therefore request you to have a good understanding of the application before starting your classes.

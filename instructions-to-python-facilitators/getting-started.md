### Hello Change-Makers, 

We welcome you aboard to teach **Basics of Python Programming, Spoken English and Touch Typing** to over **100k young women** between the age group of 15-25, from various parts of the country. Your contribution is highly valuable in creating a drastic impact in the learning journey of these young women and enabling them to get an **aspirational job**, have **a voice**, and be equipped to **bring at least 10 families out of poverty** in a financially sustainable model.

We're glad you have decided to teach young children remotely and contribute in bringing a difference in their lives. 

To ensure you have a smooth onboarding and enable you to self start this process, sharing a few simple steps you can follow.

### Step 1 - Signing into Meraki
We have a student facing Android Application and a website that caters to volunteers, partners, clients, etc. Please download the [application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.merakilearn&hl=en_IN&gl=US, "Meraki Android Application") and sign in. Spend some time and explore the application. 

*(Our students use an android phone to access Meraki, hence we request you to go over the application and understand the user interface. This can help you connect with students and solve their questions easily.)*

You can see the following videos for further assistance
* [Signing into Meraki and Home Screen](https://youtu.be/Lha-WlS2Hkg)
* [Course, Mentor, Playground](https://youtu.be/UN3us4vDHhc)

> You'll be using the [website](https://www.merakilearn.org, "Meraki") more often than the android application, to schedule your classes, etc. We ask you to use the Android Application to understand the interface from the student's perspective.

For the next steps, Sign into [Merakilearn.org](https://www.merakilearn.org, "Meraki") using your Web Browser. *(Prefer Google Chrome)*

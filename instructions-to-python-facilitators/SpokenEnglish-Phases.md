**SPOKEN ENGLISH**

If you're a fluent English speaker, we invite you to help us teach Spoken English to students willing to learn and help them speak more confidently. Sign up with NavGurukul/Meraki, an initiative to help rural, semi urban Indian students, housewives and salaried people who have studied in non english medium schools to speak English confidently.

Volunteers opting for Spoken-English Volunteering opportunity, will be spending time over the online classes with the children coming from local schools, rural and marginalised communities. 

The classes will take 1 hour per week over the course of 15 week period.

These classes will take place online over Meraki application, where students use the android application, where as the volunteers have to access via [www.Merakilearn.org](http://www.Merakilearn.org) through the calendar invites.

******We have broken down the curriculum over [www.Merakilearn.org](http://www.Merakilearn.org) in parts of 15 week course material, where we expect the students to come out in better fluency and speaking by the end of this course. This can be ensured by the following phases that we have mentioned for the flow of Volunteer and Student interaction based on the structure.

***FLOW OF SPOKEN ENGLISH:*** 
**PHASE-1: Building Comfort & Rapport**

First 5 weeks, make the students comfortable and familiarise (orientation class for assessing their levels, for introducing them to learning outcomes and approach). First 2-3 classes could be about team building related exercises, introductions, without any language correction.. just allow everyone to get comfortable in using whatever level of English they know without hesitation.

**PHASE -2:** **Usage of Elements of English**
Second 5 weeks, Grammar and language building. Each class will introduce one basic grammar topic and use exercises like fill in the blanks etc to test understanding. Can give one or two homework exercises. Take support from youtube videos, visual and interactive modes. Simple basic grammar topics and concepts to ensure students don't rote learn sentences. Here the learning outcome is to enable them to form sentences and convey their thoughts. **(*Please ensure to maintain code of conduct while sharing external media files and links)***

**PHASE-3:** **Building Fluency**

Last 5 weeks, This phase focusses on fluency, diction, pronunciation, pauses, comfort and confidence. Here the classes will have more and more of interaction and communication from the students. The idea is to get them to coherently form ideas and express in the language. Towards the end focus could be on discussion general interview topics or questions.
***Last class - Week 15 -Celebration of course completion, Certificate announcement (download), appreciation for completion, learning outcomes and feedback***

***Key Notes to be remembered while conducting these phases:***
1. The intent is to build their comfort, Spoken English and finally their fluency to be atleast interview ready.
2. Adding more vocabulary as and when required based on the pickup of students.

1. There might be a variation amongst the students with the level of their understanding and pickup, which is where volunteers need to amalgamate and process together.
2. Volunteers could routinely check with students if they are able to follow the content.

### Step 3 - Curriculum
Browse through the Curriculum to teach **Basics of Python Programming** 

* [Introduction to Python](https://www.merakilearn.org/course/199/exercise/5938)
* [Variables](https://www.merakilearn.org/course/164/exercise/5918)
* [Data Types](https://www.merakilearn.org/course/165/exercise/5675)
* [Operators](https://www.merakilearn.org/course/166/exercise/5690)
* [If-Else](https://www.merakilearn.org/course/167/exercise/5651)
* [Loops](https://www.merakilearn.org/course/168/exercise/5791)
* [Lists](https://www.merakilearn.org/course/169/exercise/5842)
* [Dictionary](https://www.merakilearn.org/course/170/exercise/5883)

The **_8 courses in Python_** are divided into [**_23 Workshop Classes_**](https://www.merakilearn.org/course/145/exercise/3523). We expect you to follow this Class division, to ensure that the sequence of learning is maintained, and a child has an opportunity to come back and attend only those specific classes she had doubts in, or had missed it for whatever reasons.

### Step 4 - Classes with Students
* Use the first five minutes to understand their learning journey on Meraki, and encourage them to self learn using Live Classes only as an extra help.
* Use the next ten minutes to recapitulate and revise previous topics, and solve their previous queries.
* You can use the second half of the class to share problems for the students to solve. It could be in the form of MCQs, True or False, Dry Run, or even Questions.
* You can assign some homework or prework a student must do before the next class, such as the next topic they can read/ study and come for in the next class.

> Keep checking in with the students if they've understood or no in between to ensure its a dialogue and not a monologue. You can try to make it as innovative and interactive as you wish to! 

You can get in touch with the students through [Chat](https://www.merakilearn.org/mentor). Please email sindhu@navgurukul.org if you want to be added to more student groups on the Mentor Tab.

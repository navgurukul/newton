name:  About Meraki
```

We at Meraki are targeting the remainder students, who *had the opportunity but lacked the aptitude* to get through the entrance assessment. There are multiple students like them, who may have had multiple opportunities, but lacked the right aptitude to make use of the provided opportunity. 

Through Meraki we wish to make programming and digital skills accessible to learners from different communities through a smartphone, and support their learning journey through our live classes. We are currently working with 500+ learners and aim to reach over 100k users by the end of the year! 

We're providing the following programs on Meraki:

- *Basics of Python* (Meraki is equipped with compiler on the phone, such that students do not have to use a desktop or laptop. All learning and practice can be facilitated on a touch screen mobile phone)
- *Touch Typing* (With the support of OTG keyboards, provided by Meraki to 5000 identified deserving students)
- *Spoken English* (Teaching students with English Speaking)

> *You can volunteer with us to help teach students in any of the above programs through Meraki!*

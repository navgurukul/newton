Now that you've decided to teach students, lets see how you can get there and get started! 

### Step 2 - Creating a Class

[Class Scheduler](https://www.merakilearn.org/class), on this page, you'll find all the classes created by other facilitators. You can recheck the date and time before creating your class, to ensure it doesn't clash with someone else's, and that your Classes are varied. Eg: Facilitator **A** creates *Class 1 - Introduction to Python* on Thursday, at 4pm. Then you can create your *Class 1 - Introduction to Python* on Saturday or Sunday, to space out similar sessions. 

You can click on the *Create a Class* button on the left hand side corner, to create your class. *(Please use the nomenclature mentioned in the [curriculum table](https://www.merakilearn.org/course/145/exercise/3523) if you're creating a workshop)*

#### What's the difference between a Workshop and a Cohort Class? 

In a Cohort system, you will be able to 
- Create recursive classes at one go. 
- Students enrolled in one Cohort class, would get notified for future classes as well. 
- Fix the class days and timings before hand, ensuring regular enrollment of students. 
- Help students continue a cohort system with one facilitator. 
- Flexibility in conducting the sessions at your pace. 
- **Nomenclature** - *[NGO Partner Name]* - Python Programming with *[Your Name]* - Batch *[Number 1,2,3,4]*

In a Workshop systen, you will be able to 
- Create one class at a time, making you schedule 23 individual classes over the course of the program
- Students enrolled in one Workshop class, would only get notified for that class. 
- Gives you flexibility in your class days and timings, but can cause irregularity in students enrollments
- There is a chance a student may end up attending classes conducted by more than one facilitator throughout their program
- Each Class has a defined set of topics to be covered.
- **Nomenclature** - Class *[Number 1,2,3,etc]* - *[Name of Class as mentioned in Curriculum Table]*

Once you have completed creating a class. You shall get an email and/or a calendar invite. You may use that to join the Google Meet you've created for your class. You can use this [Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-admit-for-google-mee/epemkdedgaoeeobdjmkmhhhbjemckmgb/related?hl=en, "Auto Admit Extension") to Auto Admit students to the Meet you've scheduled.

> It would be ideal for you to conduct a minimum of 2 classes per week, and schedule your sessions for atleast 3 weeks from the first class. This helps the student know when to expect your classes. You can always go back and edit the class, if you have to change the time or date of the class. 

### Check out the following steps only if you're a Spoken English Facilitator

**NOTE** : This will be a recusrive Session, meaning 1 volunteer will be teaching 5 students, and same students will be taught for the rest of the weeks as well to bring a cohort culture. Currently the slots available are *Weekdays/Weekends 7-9pm*.

The class conduct has to be done in following manner : 

1. Create first class over Meraki. Limit student entry to 5-7 only. Gather student email-ids, send them calendar invites for the second class. *Do not create second class over Meraki*
2. Repeat the calendar invite for the following classes.
3. This is a temporary solution till the *"Recursive Class"* - feature gets updated on Meraki.

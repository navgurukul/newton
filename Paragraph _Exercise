" Ill-maintained public toilets are a menace, and more so for women. Even in urgent situations, many prefer to refrain from entering the stinking, filthy spaces which promise nothing but overflowing lavatories.
However, Ulka Sadalkar and Rajeev Kher, who are entrepreneurs in the sanitation sector, are changing this one public toilet at a time. “We read about this concept of using old buses as restrooms for homeless people. We wanted to replicate the idea in Pune for women. The city is densely populated. There isn’t space to construct toilets. Buses wouldn’t need much space and could be refurbished. In a brainstorming session with the Pune Municipal Corporation in 2016, we decided to recycle the old, scrapped buses into toilets for women.” says Ulka. She adds that “The lack of public toilets for women is not alien to us. Women, especially, who menstruate once a month may face an emergency any time and urgently need a toilet.
Ulka and Rajeev’s company, Saraplast, provides mobile toilets for public events and they believe that “Ti” which translates to “she or her” in Marathi, is just one step ahead in utilising their expertise for the betterment of society. Ti also stands for “Toilet Integration.”Each bus has western toilets, Indian toilets, washbasins, a diaper changing place and sanitary napkins for sale. It is powered by solar energy. We want to ensure that the women who come here do not have to face any problems and since the launch, in 2016, we haven’t received any complaints or poor feedback. We have installed 11 such health centres—we call them those, so it takes the stigma away from public toilets—in the busy parts of Pune where the footfall is high, but there are no restrooms for the women to use. We are targeting the lower-income class because those are the women who need these toilets the most,” says Ulka. But that doesn’t mean that the quality is compromised in any way. In fact, as Ulka mentioned, one toilet receives an average of 150 ladies per day!"

" Aditi Deodhar is an IT consultant based out of Pune and holds a Master's degree in Industrial Mathematics with Computer Applications. One day, she struct with the personal pain of the smoke generated by burning the dry leaves that fell from a tree in her housing society, she asked the gardener to not burn the leaves, the gardener complied and left the heap of dry leaves in a corner. After a couple of days, the heap of dry leaves was becoming unmanageable and the gardener asked Aditi for resolution, to which she had no answer. She went on to online forums for possible solutions and the solution came in the form of a requirement from Sujata Naphade, a cultivator of food in her plot for three families. When her plot was left vacant for a long time, a builder filled it with construction waste leaving the soil infertile. To turn this soul productive, she needed dry leaves and thus, Aditi's question met its answer. Aditi visited Sujata's plot and supplied her with dry leaves but to her surprise, Sujata needed much more. That's how Aditi understood the 'value' of dry leaves. Gardeners and farmers require huge amounts of dry leaves to keep their soil fertile and nutrient-rich. Dry leaves supply the soil with carbon-based compounds. BOOM! When there are so many benefits of dry leaves. Why burn them down? She decided to take to the internet and embarked on her journey to connect leaf-givers with leaf-takers and there emerged the "BROWN LEAF" website. She also created a Facebook page and Whatsapp group where people communicate with each other and mutually cater to their respective requirements. Today, Brown Leaf vibrantly hosts the activities and spreads awareness on mulching, composting, and donating dry leaves. No financial transactions are involved in this whole process as it is just like a discussion forum. 
The person who has the stock of dry leaves drops a message in the group indicating the quantity and address. The person in need would collect them. That's how simple it works."

" Suraj Bai Meena is a 33 year old resident of a village named Bhuri Pahadi present in the periphery of the Ranthambore National Park.Her village is not known to favor girls to receive education as the parents end up giving double the dowry amount for an educated girl. While growing up, she looked at her brother Hemraj, as an inspiration who worked as a naturalist himself in the national park. Suraj recalls that “I would sneak out and go with him to the national park. Memories of those trips spurred my own interest in becoming one.” It was because of Hemraj’s insistence that Suraj was allowed to move to Sawai Madhopur, where she was enrolled in a school. “Those were the best days of my life,” she mentions. After completing her education and training, she joined the national park as a naturalist  and was subjected to many taunts. “My family said that being around foreign tourists would ‘corrupt’ me. The men I worked with would pass lewd comments and mock me. I did not let any of it get to me,” she says.
It took Suraj a very long time to change her family’s mindset. They belonged to the school of thought that only wanted to keep girls at home, she says. “The entire village took it upon themselves to try and get me to leave my job and sit at home. It was all of them against me,” she says. Through all these ups and downs, Hemraj stood by her side and supported her.
During the early days of her career, she became aware that communication skills are extremely essential for her profession.She recalls one incident: “In one of my first few guided tours, I was with a foreigner couple. We had sighted a bird, and while I knew the local name for it, I was unable to explain what it was called to them. That was when the need to learn more dawned upon me.”She joined a Hindi medium school and her first exposure to English was in 10th Class but she  never shied away from learning, and that has been her biggest trait.She started maintaining a small notebook in which she would make notes of all the new words she came across in conversation. Once back home, she would find the meaning of each word in the dictionary and make a note. “This is how I learnt conversational English,” she says. It has been 15 years since she became a naturalist and has also received awards like ‘Best Lady Guide’ by the Maharaja of Jaipur, amongst other accolades. “The work I have put in as a naturalist is akin to a Ph.D. I have learnt how to identify calls, track footprints, and study the behaviour of other animals,” she says. With unflinching support from her husband and in-laws, she continues to strive for better.Keeping the desire to learn alive, she has also completed her BA, MA, and B.Ed over the years, all while working and managing her home and two children. 
While she has been working for 15 years as a naturalist and guide, Suraj says that even now, each trip feels like it’s her first. “The excitement of spotting an animal, whether it is a tiger, sloth bear, deer, or even a bird, is just as exhilarating as the first time.” "

"Prachi Shevgaonkar, a student of  mass communication at Symbiosis International University, Pune, when in her first semester of college she googled, “What is the biggest problem in the world today?” Climate change popped up. She recalls “I was very surprised to see this because while global experts and scientists were talking about how climate change is one of the most pressing issues in front of us today, nobody around me was really talking about it. I started reading more about climate change, the role I was playing in it. I learned that we only have three decades to avoid the worst effects of climate change. It troubled me. I wanted to do something about it, at least at my own level. My family and I took a simple pledge to reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent every year.” Prachi tried to find out if there was anything like it already out there that could help individuals reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.Surprisingly, there was nothing, and she took it upon herself to create something.“I realised that numbers are important because I needed to measure in order to change anything,” she says.This is how Cool The Globe was born.
The vision for the app is to make climate action achievable, simple and quantifiable, and to empower individuals to take small but consistent measures to contribute to surmounting climate change. The road to making this app wasn’t an easy one as she had too many options to work upon but finally went ahead with the  amount of CO2eq-avoided GHG emissions as a uniform metric of measuring impact
She took help from 200+ students from her college for beta testing to “make the app foolproof”. She says it took her three years – from conceptualising to design. The app was officially launched in December 2020. 
Prachi ran a video campaign to promote the app, which went viral on social media. Entrepreneurs like Harsh Mariwala, Chairman of Marico, tweeted about it and helped spread the word. 
Fast Forward to 2022, Cool The Globe now has 24,000+ users from 100+ countries, coming together to take action against climate change. The users collectively avoided 1 million kg of greenhouse gas emissions so far. Prachi was recently awarded the Olive Crown Award by the International Advertising Association and named the young Green Crusader of the year.
Her next target is to integrate climate action in the lives of one billion citizens. "

"Minushri Madhumita and Amrita Jagatdeo are childhood friends from Kalahandi, a western region of Odisha. After finishing school together, Minushri pursued post-graduation in Chemistry and a diploma in Management, while Amrita became an electrical engineer with a postgraduate management degree in Finance.
Minushri felt a calling for the social sector which led her to start an NGO(Non-Governmental Organization) in the year 2008 named Bihang, which focused on to bring computer literacy in government schools of Odisha.  
While running her NGO she learned that in the late 2000s, the government announced a scheme to set up computer labs in schools to impart computer literacy as a mandatory course in the school curriculum. “But the decision had practical limitations. Computer education was neglected in government schools as erratic power supply in remote parts deprived the children of accessing the computer labs. Moreover, many children could not afford to access computers at home or at cafes,” she says. Understanding the gap present, she started to set up a solar-powered computer lab in various inter-colleges(high school/senior school/junior college) in western Uttar Pradesh and observed a spike in the number of children who came to these labs and were also able to attract other children from the teacher’s native villages. Minushri quit her job in 2013 to focus full time on the NGO. 
Minushri and Amrita later observed that their panel supplier was providing them low quality products which would require frequent maintenance, driving up the cost of running the lab. Amrita decided to craft products herself given her expertise in electronics. She quit her job in 2015, and like Minuhri, decided to dedicate her time and energy entirely to the cause. In 2016, they started Think Raw Solutions and started identifying problems that fishermen and farmers face.They worked closely with farmer producer companies in providing them with solar-based solutions for agriculture.They came up with 3 different devices which helps in different phases of farming.Krishi Dhanu- helps in dispensing fertiliser and pesticide which is powered by solar energy.Dhivara Mitra-a floating device with sensors to analyse water health and trigger the aeration process as required which is also powered by solar energy.Matsya Bandhu- is a seed and fish feed dispersal device.
The entrepreneurs say the prototype of the mentioned products are ready and on the way to getting commercialised. “We hope that our technological interventions enable us to reduce the hardships of fishermen and farmers and increase their productivity and allow them to take a step towards progressive farming,” Minushri says.

Kajal did her Tenth Standard from Gurugram(Haryana) she was looking for vocational courses because college education was expensive given the meagre income for a family of six. By chance, she got to know about Navgurukul, a Non-Governmental Organization-NGO with centres in Bengaluru and Pune training children from poor backgrounds in software skills.
“The program was just for a year and there was guaranteed job at the end of it,” says Kajal who, in fact, completed her training in just five months and then cracked the entrance and interview to Mindtree.
For someone who had never heard of coding, how did she pick up the skills in such a short time? “Coding is very similar to solving math problems and I was always good at that. Once I learned the basics, I didn’t find it difficult,” says Kajal, who is fluent in Python and NodeJS.
Now with an annual package of Rs 3.5 lakh, Kajal is the highest-earning member of her family. She has been sending money home every month since she started working last May. Her family recently moved to a two-room home from a one-room accommodation. "

" Sonam is from Indore District which is located in western Madhya Pradesh. She was in her college doing her B.Sc in Microbiology when the principal introduced her to Navgurukul and the concept of learning software engineering in a place far from her home- in Bengaluru, but it was different from what is taught in a regular college. In Navgurukul, students learn by themselves in peer groups as there is no hierarchy present in the Navgurukul Campus which helps everyone in growing together. Her principal played a key role in convincing her parents to allow her to go to the Bengaluru campus. After completing her B.Sc degree she went to the Bengaluru campus, where her first observation was that the seniors, as well as the juniors, were helping each other with patience and without any judgement which allowed everyone to ascend progressively. 
As she was entering the domain of programming, the python language was something that she was having an easy time with, but with perseverance, she was able to understand python. She says “Python ‘the animal’ was now Python ‘the friend’ which helped me in solving problems, but currently I would prefer JavaScript over Python.” With the help of Navgurukul, she was able to secure a job with a salary of Rs 2.4 lakh per annum which has improved her family’s standard of living. Sonam is extremely entrepreneurial and wants to build her own start-up which would solve the most basic but critical problems. "

" Annu is from the Kishanganj District located at the eastern end of Bihar. “I was born in a middle-class family, rife with numerous conflicts in the households. I grew up seeing family members turning against each other and engaging in lots of verbal violence. One such family feud left my father financially broke and emotionally shaken.” she says. Soon going to school was getting difficult as her parents left the join family and her mother started a departmental store and had to sell off assets for her to go to a good school. Seeing her parents in such conditions where they are doing everything in their power to get her educated is also one major contributor to her hard-working spirit. 
She recalls “Seeing my parents’ struggle, the only way I could contribute was by studying as hard as possible to become a financially independent person someday.” Due to financial barriers, she opted for a B.Com degree in a local college which she was not very fond of and then time presented her the opportunity in the form of Navgurukul with whom she came in contact with the help of the NGO Project Potential, which has a presence in Kishanganj. She was able to convince her parents to drop out from B.Com and go to the Navgurukul Bengaluru campus with patience and perseverance. After coming to Navgurukul, she observed that this is not a conventional formal education platform, she recalls “It was everything that a regular college or school is not – it was driven by us, the students. The biggest surprise was that we did not have exams or the pressure of grades. 
There was also no notion of authority because we did not have teachers. We all did peer-learning – mentor each other and learn at our own pace. The environment there welcomed vulnerability and encouraged open conversations about almost everything.” She gives credit to the atmosphere at the campus which helped her in building self-confidence as most of the decisions on the campus are taken by the students, she states one such example “I remember I was often given a location on Google Map and asked to go get things on my own for the centre. Back home, my parents would not let me go alone anywhere other than college. Here, I was not only making decisions related to expenses and other resources but was also travelling on my own.” She later joined MindTree and after working there for some years she got promoted to ‘Senior Software Engineer’ and has a salary of 5.75 Lakh per annum which has helped in increasing the standard of living of her family.

" Rani is from Patharghatti, a small village that comes under the Kishanganj District located at the eastern end of Bihar. Her life in that village was not something which she cherished as most of the time she was in a constant state of turmoil due to internal conflicts within her family as financially they were falling short on meeting the ends for day-to-day chores. Tensions grew in her joint family due to which her parents decided to separate from the joint household and her father decided to go to Delhi as a daily wage labourer and her mother was making earthen utensils which would bring enough income to have food on their plates. She had to watch her parents combing back home and throwing tantrums when the earnings on that day were not enough, seeing their misery, Rani decided that she will make sure that her parents will live with dignity once she gets a job. After some time, she shifted to Delhi with her mother and siblings. In Delhi, her family was having a tough time financially but was able to bring food at the end of the day. While her parents were away at work, she would see children boarding a bus to go to their school in bright and shiny uniforms. One day she asked her father to get her admitted to a school without wondering about the finances required for the process. Her father admitted her to a nearby school managed by a Neev NGO. The principal of the school was going to transfer some students to prestigious Delhi Public School, she convinced her father for her to go, to which her father agreed.
Even though she had come to a big school with good teachers and resources, but her peers never really welcomed her and made her realise that she comes from a poor background compared to the other students. This was emotionally tormenting for her which resulted in her not paying attention in her studies. This leads her to get bad results in the end due to which her teacher told her to call her parents to discuss the way she performed in the school. This event shocks her to the core. She was in distress and was not able to figure out her next move. She couldn't tell her parents about this event as she was the one who was adamant about going to the bigger school. " This was a moment when the thought of giving up came to her or just stop dreaming big as it might not be my cup of tea. But she understood that people with dreams make such events their turning point. I decided that I will make this event my turning point in life". With this thought in her mind, she came back home, took out her textbooks and started studying, and chose not to speak about what happened in her school with her parents. The very next day she was able to show improvements to her teachers and with time her teachers started believing her. Since then, she has consistently topped her class . After 5th standard, she came back to her previous school which was managed by Neev NGO.
She was in 10th standard when she came across Navgurukul and the concept of learning software engineering free of cost. Until then she had no clue about software but was determined enough to ascend her barrier and went to apply for the program. She went to the Gurugram campus for 3 months but the campus was later shifted to Bengaluru. This was another shock to her as she was well aware that her parents would not allow her to go that far from home all by herself. She stayed back to complete her 10th standard and decided to go 3 more of her friends to the Bengaluru Campus. Her father personally went along with her to the Navgurukul campus in Bengaluru  for his own satisfaction, saw the campus where Rani would be staying  and then went back to Delhi.
Rani was experiencing a different form of education at Navgurukul. There were no teachers, students studied in peer groups, which is not similar to the conventional way of educating. It did not take her much time to be on talking terms with everyone and was able to work without any hindrance. The organisers were very polite in their approach and would understand the difficulties that she was facing and give her enough time and guidance to come up with the solution. As she was 16 years old, getting a job in a company without a college degree was not easy and at that time her father emphasised that she should complete her 12th standard and then look for a job. After multiple rejections, she was given an offer to join as an intern and when she turned 18 years old she became a full-time employee. She later went to give a Josh Talk which is available on Youtube.She aims to join Google as a front-end developer and wants to ensure that no other girl should go through the same hardship she had to experience.

 "  Moni is from Ghazipur District which is located in the south-eastern end of Uttar Pradesh. She along with her parents run a shop in Ghazipur, but recently her mother had taken charge as her father had developed health complications. She joined the Milaan foundation very early on , which helped her to complete her schooling and educated her about women rights. After clearing the 12th class examination, the Milaan foundation introduced her to Navgurukul, an organisation which teaches programming free of cost at the resident campus at Bengaluru. She was able to clear the entrance test and the culture-fit interview after which she was all set to go to Benglauru and start her journey to financial freedom, but before doing so, she had to convince her parents which was extremely tough as Bengaluru was 1900 kilometre away from Ghazipur, to reach Bengaluru one to has to travel for nearly 2 days in a train from Ghazipur. With all her might, she was able to convince her parents and reached the Bengluru campus on 14th August 2020. On her first day, she was showered with love and care which made her feel at home even though she did not know any of them. The self-study philosophy that Navgurukul practices allowed her to grow herself away from all the judgement and the freedom offered at the campus helped her recognize herself. Programming presented a challenge at first so much so she started to think that she was not made for this,but with practice she bounced back and got a hold over programming. Currently she has joined the fellowship program by Hyperverge where they pay her stipend for living expenses and train her to become a MERN stack developer, although her aim is to become a Full stack developer at an IT firm.

 " Srishti is from Pakur district which is located in the eastern end of Jharkhand and very close to West Bengal. “Pakur is not that developed in terms of infrastructure but the residents of the district are open to the idea of sending their children outside  Pakur for education and  jobs,” she describes.Srishti was working in an NGO and came to Navgurukul in the search of a high income job that Navgurukul promised although she had no clue about programming. On her first day at the Bengaluru campus, she was surprised to see girls from all across India at the Bengaluru campus. “ Girls here come from across the country with very diverse backgrounds and bring their diverse skills and experience to the table, and I was able to learn a lot from them” she says with joy. She also goes on to talk about the tasks which are assigned to them at the campus such as cooking turns, cleaning turns, getting supplies for the campus and running various committees while learning to code and communicate,“These activities might look strange at first for someone who is not used to taking up responsibility, but let me tell you that with such diverse set of girls who are assigned to manage food or supplies in the campus, allows the girls to take a stand or  take a decision during intense situations, which is an important attribute to have to become financially independent” she says boldly.She was fascinated by the way the pedagogy was set which is one-eighty degrees opposite to what is preferred in schools and colleges. She fondly describes “ There are no teachers and there are no exams. The philosophy of self learning is followed here and if anyone is stuck somewhere, then the appointed member of the particular student gives them a clue to steer towards the solution, they never give us the solution which  can be frustrating at times but also pushes us to achieve the solution . Mentors are  girls who also came to Navgurukul to learn programming and have learned 2 to 3 chapters and then go on to guide their juniors who have recently joined Navgurukul.” Currently she is an intern at Appscrib and her long term goal is to become a full-stack developer.

 " Shahnaaz is from Gulbarga officially known as Kalaburagi District which is situated in northern Karnataka. Her father is a truck driver and transports fruits from one city to another and her mother is a homemaker. After completing her 12th class exams in 2020, her neighbour told her about Navgurukul-a place where one can learn programming for free and get high-income jobs,  fascinated by the idea that she decided to dive into the internet to search more about Navgurukul. After clearing all the exams and interviews, she was all set to go to the Bengaluru campus. She describes her memory of coming to the campus as nothing less than extraordinary, the atmosphere was filled with love, compassion, and ambition and the campus manager was always approachable and maintained the campus to be free from all societal judgments. These factors lit a path for her, a path towards self-love, financial independence and to become the decision-maker of her life. Programming was not easy to grasp at first but she did not give up and studied with diligence and also a lot of support from her mentors. She mentions the speciality of Navgurukul with conviction “ The responsibilities that they distribute among us students are the secret ingredients which makes Navgurukul different. We learn life lessons while running the entire campus by ourselves. I served as a Discipline coordinator, Training and placement coordinator, admissions team member, and mentor, which are very diverse responsibilities which come with their own set of challenges  that I had to overcome and move forward.” She goes on to say “ In a matter of 8 months, I was offered a job with Navgurukul as an academic associate. The opportunity to truly know each student's strengths and weaknesses as time passes has been a life-changing and eye-opening experience for me. Even when the job was strenuous, the joy of watching a student improve made it all worth it, much like watching a butterfly unfold its wings. Being able to contribute to a person's total transformation brings me a great deal of happiness.” She later moved to NatWest as a backend developer intern and started to contribute her support to her parents financially which gave her immense pride. Her goal is to become a full-fledged data scientist. "

 " Gulnaaz hails from Jajpur district in eastern Odisha. Her father is a private tutor and her mother is a school teacher. At home, education was given utmost priority and her family ensured their children were given every opportunity to learn. 
When she was in her second year of B.Sc, she became a part of a Self Help Group (SHG) in her vicinity, where she was introduced to NavGurukul and its unconventional way of learning. She was surprised to learn that one could pick an unknown subject as coding, learn free of cost and also get employed as a coder within a year. 
She was eager to join NavGurukul, learn programming, get an aspirational job and support her family financially, but her parents were concerned about sending their only daughter 1500 km away from themselves to a city she had never been to. Nevertheless, her determination to grow prevailed. Her parents were touched knowing Gulnaaz’s main motivation to join NavGurukul was to take over the responsibilities of the family from them and let them rest. 
She joined the Sarjapur campus in April 2021 and was amused to see girls from across the country living together like sisters. Although she was missing home, the support staff on campus made her feel welcome and she could settle in with ease. 
At NavGurukul, Gulnaaz learnt the importance of being punctual and professional. She got practical experience of managing her time, prioritising her tasks and taking important decisions keeping everyone’s best interests in mind, when she was made an academic apprentice. She also learnt to take ownership of her actions and be confident to face any challenge that comes her way. 
The self governed community lifestyle and peer education support system at NavGurukul gave her immense confidence in her capabilities. She now takes pride in being a self learner and knowing no mountain is hard for her to climb.
She is currently working at a Delhi-based company named Sheroes with an annual salary package of Rs. 4.2 lakhs. "

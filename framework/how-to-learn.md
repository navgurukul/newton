# How to Learn?

We have been learning since the moment we were born, all throughout our life. We learn from what we see, what we hear, and most importantly what we do. Yet, when we move to more specialised forms of learning, e.g. Software Engineering, learning appears to be a little complicated. A lot of complication is a part of how we teach, how learning doesn’t use the context properly, etc. Yet learning a skill like Software Engineering requires more - hard work, discipline, commitment, seriousness, etc.

We are going to talk some of the factors that we believe are important for learning, and can’t be ignored. These factors help us design the experience at NavGurukul, and at the same time should also be helpful for you to evaluate and improve your learning.

Students will be defined as Juniors or Seniors as per following.
- when you join NavGurukul as a student (Juniors)
- when you start working outside NavGurukul (as an Intern or as a full time hire) or six months have been spent whichever is later (Seniors)
This classification will be used in later sections as different expectations are there from the Juniors or Seniors. For example, each Senior student mentor one or two Junior students and are responsible for their learning.

## Healthy Mind
Healthy mind is the first and foremost step to learn properly. If you are distracted, lack curiosity, or simply not able to enjoy your learning processes it would be very hard for you to learn. There can be many forms of distractions which let you not learn properly. While some of them are easy to be ignored, some others aren’t as easy. For example, using facebook or WhatsApp are distractions and students should stay away from them. In fact, we would wish to advise all the Junior students to deactivate their facebook and WhatsApp profiles.

At the same time, there are problems which have no clear solution or path ahead. For example, issues related to illness of a close family member are harder to be dealt with. These often create an emotional toll which makes it harder for us to focus on our learning. Meditation and counselling can be of huge help in such cases.

Similarly, it is important that you love what you are doing. If you feel disinterested or disengaged with whatever you learning, it will be hard for you to learn it properly. While it is not necessary for you to learn complete Software Engineering, but it is important to fall in love with some or other components and excel on them. Learning only for a future job often leads to drastically poor results.

Curious mind is another very important part of a healthy mind. It helps you explore and learn beyond what you listen or hear. We are all blessed with a curious mind, though we stop asking questions during our childhood. It is very important that we get back our eagerness to ask questions and learn new things.

In case you feel, that you aren’t feeling mentally healthy, don’t worry. Talk to your facilitator and the facilitator should be able to suggest you the next steps.

## Seriousness
Often during the course due to variety of reasons, you may not feel serious about what you are studying and start taking things lightly. It is easy to see how if you are not serious, you aren’t only wasting your time but also others’ time. By design, our course has as an intense nature with more than 12-14 productive hours a day, and keeping yourself and committed throughout is the key thing. If you feel that you need a break due to the rigorous schedule, there are ample ways to do so.

It is also important to understand that we run on limited resources (money from donors, and time & dedication of seniors and volunteers to teach you). It would be a pity that you are wasting those resources by not being serious enough. You should talk to your mentor immediately and discuss the potential reasons for feeling so. If you continue to stay non-serious for long, mentor would be expected to hand over a card with a strong warning to you.

## Introspection
When you are doing so many things, there are always chances that there are things not being done right or things which could be done better. You need to introspect daily and understand yourself in more depth. Introspect is one way, we learn most about ourselves, and hence it directly helps us to identify our weaknesses and strengths and improve ourselves. Here, are a few things that must be done for introspection.

### Daily Standups
This is the most crucial and a non-compromisable step. Every day learning should start with a 15-20 mins standup where all the students of a particular group stand up and answer following questions individually:

### Maintain a diary
This is your personal space to write in somewhat more detail about the day - how did the things go, how can they be made better, are you not able to focus, if you aren’t able to focus - why you aren’t able to focus, and so on.

### Mentor Slots

### Weekly community meetings

## Hard Work
## Discipline
## Technique - Active vs Passive
## Teaching Others
## Revision

## Aptitude
One of the questions that has always puzzled us is the relation between aptitude and subsequent learning. We have seen various manifestations between aptitude and how people learn in especially later part of their lives. What is aptitude? How aptitude is built? What role has the nature to play, and what role does the nurture has to play? While all these questions are quite interesting, it is important to understand that aptitude is a small part of learning and can be overshadowed with other factors if done properly. We can see examples all around where students who appear to have lesser aptitude appear to score much better than the students who appear to have better aptitude. We will thus focus on these factors in this report.

# Need to Serve?

We fundamentally believe education should be free or really affordable for one and all. While that is a great ideal to uphold, but it is important to understand that it would require a very directed and thorough input to achieve this. To understand simply, a lot of input is needed for this to be really possible. Given this input, what should we expect out of the people who achieve this **free** education.

Should this **free** education focus them on providing a **passport to privilege** or should they  have an obligation to serve others?

It might be important here to understand what privilege means. Privilege is what helps us where we reach where we are. Privilege is what separates us from someone who never went to school. When we achieve something, we feel that we have an important role in achieving that. While it can’t be argued otherwise, but at the same time role that the privilege might have played to make that happen may be far greater than you have imagined to be. Privilege is a big topic of its own, and we would encourage you to read more about it on the Internet. By the way, the fact that you are able to use Internet has also been made possible because of the privilege you enjoy. In India, only 33% people have the privilege of using the Internet.

It should be thus realised, that the fact that we are able to achieve this education at NavGurukul is because of whatever little or great privilege that we have. Similarly, the fact that NavGurukul exists is, because of two reasons
- there were patrons like donors, team members, etc. who decided to **serve** you
- these patrons themselves had the privilege to serve you

It would be fair to expect that these patrons who wanted to serve people, who need help, want to serve as many people as they can and not create a group of privileged people. The size of problems that we are dealing with - poverty, abuse, casteism, etc. are humongous and can’t be solved unless you play your role in solving them. While we strongly argue that the students coming out of the system should serve people, we clearly understand and believe that you would have your own style of serving people, and no particular format of service is expected. You can choose to serve in your own ways, that suits you, that makes you happier.

To serve others, you need to have a certain comfort level at your end. If you are suffering from problems at your end or lack of resources (e.g. time, money, etc.), it would be harder to serve others. We believe that rather than postponing to serve in the future, start serving in a small way that makes you happy and isn’t too hard on you. The idea of serving in future, rather in present would be lucrative to one and all. And it would be expected that you are truthful to yourself, and realise an urgent and important need to serve others.

At the same time, we do understand that the **idea to serve** can’t be forced upon an individual, and hence the idea is not to force people to serve but to create an environment where students can understand the importance of serving others, and at the same time find an alignment with their happiness.

We will come back to **how to serve**, once we have covered **how to learn**.

	"objects-destructuring_key3": "Here navgurukul.mentor is referring to Priya and that is assigning to name a new `variable`.\nAnd one navgurukul.mentee is referring to Sapna and it is assigned to mentee another new `variable`.\n",
	"objects-destructuring_key4": "A neater `code` for that is rather than create new `variables`\n",
	"objects-destructuring_key5": "Here is where the concept of destructuring the object introduced for, To write a neater and structured `code` like this and for removing the extra `variables` from the program.\n",
	"objects-destructuring_key6": "As you can see in the above example, the object from the Left hand side has the properties mentor and mentee with the values Priya and Sapna respectively. Note that you need to give the same property names in ({mentor,mentee} = navgurukul); , so that mentorâ€™s value from navgurukul will store into mentor in curly braces and same for mentee. If you do not do so it will throw a reference `error` that the property name you have mentioned is not defined.\n",
	"objects-destructuring_key7": "( ) why we are using the parenthesis around ({mentor,mentee} = navgurukul);  that may be a question to you is right. If I am not taking parenthesis it will give me an `error` as `SyntaxE`rror: Unexpected token '='.\n",
	"objects-destructuring_key8": "Why the `error` is coming is because when the `code` will see {} curly braces it will feel it as block `code`. That's why for avoiding this `error` we used () parenthesis.\n",

	"objects-destructuring_key10": "Without parenthesis you can do like also:\n",
	"objects-destructuring_key11": "By putting const you are declaring them and you are destructuring (formatting the data in the structured manner)the mentor and mentee from the navgurukul object. It is important to maintain the data in the `code` by using less space and it helps to write the `code` neatly as well.\n"

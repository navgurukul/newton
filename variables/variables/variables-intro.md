## What are Variables ?

**VARIABLE** is a memory/location in which the data is stored.Whose value we can change that is called a VARIABLE. You can give any name to the **VARIABLE** and you can store anything in the variable.

1. Just as we can store `123` in a VARIABLE named as`variable_x`.
2. Similarly we can put `9999`in a VARIABLE named as`a`.

As you remember that 123 and 9999 are INTEGERS.

```python
variable_x=123
a=9999
```

Let's see what happens when we print`variable_x` and `a`.

```python
print (variable_x, a)
```

We can give another value to `variable_x`,by this  `variable_x`will be updated. As you can see below that we have given a value 9.9 to the variable_x now.

```python
variable_x=9.9
```

Now print variable_x to see its value.

```python
print (variable_x)
```

As you remember that `9.9` is float. That means we can give different values to a variable.Value of  `a`is not changed because we have not updated it. Now we can update `a` and make a new variable `b`.

```python
a='hello world'
b='navgurukul'
```

Now print them to see the output.

```python
print (variable_x, a, b)
```

### Dry Run 

You all have to do these questions using pen and paper. Solve all the exercises in your notebooks and ask other people around you to check the solution.

To understand about the dry run of variables,please see this video.

```python
a = 3
b = 4
c = a * b
a = b * c
b = a + c
c = a + b + c
```

```python
a = 1
b = 2
b = a
```

```python
a = 7
b = 8 * 4
b = a
```

```python
a = 1
b = 2
c = b
b = a 
a = c
```

```python
a = 1
b = a*2
c = b*2
a = c*2
```

```python
 a = 100
 a = a + 50
 a = a / 3
 a = a * 2
```

```python
 a = 10
 b = 10
 c = a * b
 a = c - b
 b = c + a
 c = a * c
```

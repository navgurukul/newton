## What are Variables ?

**VARIABLE** is a memory/location in which the data is stored. Whose value we can change that is called a VARIABLE. You can give any name to the **VARIABLE** and you can store anything in the variable.

1. Just as we can store `123` in a VARIABLE named as `variable_x`.
2. Similarly we can put `9999` in a VARIABLE named as `a`.

As you remember that 123 and 9999 are INTEGERS.

```python
variable_x=123
a=9999
# Let's see what happens when we print `variable_x` and `a`.
print (variable_x, a)
```



We can give another value to `variable_x`, by this `variable_x` will be updated. As you can see below that we have given a value 9.9 to the `variable_x` now.

```python
variable_x=9.9
# Now print `variable_x` to see its value.
print (variable_x)
```



As you remember that `9.9` is float. That means we can give different values to a variable. Value of `a` is not changed because we have not updated it. Now we can update `a` and make a new variable `b`.

#### Now you know in a variable we can store some data but how computer store data do you know

```python
a='hello world'
b='navgurukul'
# Now print them to see the output.
print (variable_x, a, b)
```




### `Dry Run`

You all have to do these questions using pen and paper. Solve all the exercises in your notebooks and ask other people around you to check the solution.

To understand about the `dry run` of variables, please see this video.

#### Examples :-

```python
a = 3
b = 4
c = a * b
a = b * c
b = a + c
c = a + b + c
```

```python
a = 1
b = 2
b = a
```

```python
a = 7
b = 8 * 4
b = a
```

```python
a = 1
b = 2
c = b
b = a 
a = c
```

```python
a = 1
b = a*2
c = b*2
a = c*2
```

```python
 a = 100
 a = a + 50
 a = a / 3
 a = a * 2
```

```python
 a = 10
 b = 10
 c = a * b
 a = c - b
 b = c + a
 c = a * c
```

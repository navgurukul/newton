# Rules for naming a VARIABLE 

In Python for naming variables ,some rules are followed. If we do not follow  these rules then the *program* is not going to be correct.

Keep these 3 rules always in your mind:

1. Name starts with either a - Letter or  an _ (underscore).
2. Only letters, underscore or numbers can be present in the Name( no special characters).
3. It is Case Sensitive (means varx, varX, Varx are different variables).

**Correct Names** - `variable`,  `var123`,  `var_12`,  `_var`,  `_12`  
**Incorrect Names** - `var@iable`, `123var`, `var.123`  
**Different Names** - `varX`, `varx`, `Varx`, `VarX`

**Activity: In Python shell,try to put values  in the Incorrect variable names. See how python gives errors.**

## Rules for naming a VARIABLE 


In Python for naming variables, some rules are followed. If we do not follow these rules, then the *program* is not going to be correct.  
  
Keep these 3 rules always in your mind :  
  
1. The name starts with either some - Letter or an _ (underscore).  
2. Only letters, underscore or numbers can be present in the Name (no special characters).  
3. It is `Case Sensitive` (means var, VAR, Var are different variables).

**Correct Names** - `variable`, `var123`, `var_12`, `_var`, `_12`  
**Incorrect Names** - `var@iable`, `123var`, `var.123`  
**Different Names** - `varX`, `varx`, `Varx`, `VarX`

### Activity : 
In `Python shell`, try to put values in the Incorrect variable names. See how python gives errors.

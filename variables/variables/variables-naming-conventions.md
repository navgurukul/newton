name: How to name Variables? 
```


It is very important to give correct `name` to a `Variable`.  
  
If you don't give names properly, then nobody will be able to read your Code, as they won't be able to understand that for what purpose the variable is used?

`camelCase`, 
`PascalCase`,
`snake_case`,
`UPPER_CASE`,
`kebab-case`
are five most popular `cases` for naming.

You can read in detail about the [`cases`](https://www.chaseadams.io/most-common-programming-case-types/) here.

In Python, we usually use :

| What Name?       | Which Case?  |
|----------------|--------------|
| `variableNames`  | `camelCase`  |
| `CONSTANT_NAMES` |` UPPER_CASE` |
| `function_names` | `snake_case` |

Also, to give names to a variable is a skill in itself. Read this [article](https://hackernoon.com/the-art-of-naming-variables-52f44de00aad) to understand about naming conventions.

### Note : Many candidates get rejected in their interviews, because they don't name the variables properly, and the company does not like this.

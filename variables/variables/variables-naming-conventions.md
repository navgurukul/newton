name: How to name Variables? 
```

It is very important to give correct `name`to a `Variable`.

If you don't give names properly,then nobody will be able to read your Code, as they won't be able to understand that for what purpose the variable is used?

camelCase
PascalCase
snake_case
UPPER_CASE
kebab-case
are five most popular cases for naming.

You can read in detail about the [cases](https://www.chaseadams.io/most-common-programming-case-types/) here.

In Python, we usually use:

| What Name?    | Which Case?  |
|----------------|--------------|
| variableNames  | camelCase    |
| CONSTANT_NAMES | UPPER_CASE   |
| function_names | snake_case   |

Also, to give names to a variable is a skill in itself. Read this [article](https://hackernoon.com/the-art-of-naming-variables-52f44de00aad) to understand about naming conventions.

### P.S: Many candidates get rejected in their interviews, because they don't name the variables properly, and the company does not like this.

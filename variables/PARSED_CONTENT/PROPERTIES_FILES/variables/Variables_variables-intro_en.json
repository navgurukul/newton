	"variables-intro_key2": "**`VARIABLE`** is a memory/location in which the data is stored. Whose value we can change that is called a `VARIABLE`. You can give any name to the **`VARIABLE`** and you can store anything in the `variable`.\n",
	"variables-intro_key3": "Just as we can store `123` in a `VARIABLE` named as `variable_x`.\n",
	"variables-intro_key4": "Similarly we can put `9999` in a `VARIABLE` named as `a`.\n\n\n",
	"variables-intro_key5": "As you remember that 123 and 9999 are `INTEGERS`.\n",
	"variables-intro_key6": "We can give another value to `variable_x`, by this `variable_x` will be updated. As you can see below that we have given a value 9.9 to the `variable_x` now.\n",
	"variables-intro_key7": "As you remember that `9.9` is `float`. That means we can give different values to a `variable`. Value of `a` is not changed because we have not updated it. Now we can update `a` and make a new `variable` `b`.\n",
	"variables-intro_key8": "Now you know in a `variable` we can store some data but how computer store data do you know\n",

	"variables-intro_key10": "You all have to do these questions using pen and paper. Solve all the exercises in your notebooks and ask other people around you to check the solution.\n",

In this exercise, you’ll learn a few new methods and functions that come with Python. You’ll also learn about augmented assignment operators and string interpolation. These things don’t let you do anything you couldn't do before, but they are nice shortcuts to make coding easier.

Bagels is a deduction game you can play with a friend. Your friend thinks up a random 3-digit number with no repeating digits, and you try to guess what the number is. After each guess, your friend gives you three types of clues:

1. **Bagels** – None of the three digits you guessed is in the secret number.
2. **Pico** – One of the digits is in the secret number, but your guess has the digit in the wrong place.
3. **Fermi** – Your guess has a correct digit in the correct place.

You can get multiple clues after each guess. If the secret number is 456 and your guess is 546 the clues would be “fermi pico pico”. The 6 provides “fermi” and the 5 and 4 provide “pico pico”.

	"section-0_key2": "NavGurukulâ€™s constitution adopts principles of the Swaraj and a rule by people, for the people. It is important that each and every member of the facility feels <b>empowered</b> by the constitution and the <b>elected members</b> act as <b>facilitators</b> rather than as power centers. To ensure that the power lies with all the members there are various safeguards like Right to Recall, but most importantly the right culture leads to the same. Hence, each member is encouraged to participate and take ownership."

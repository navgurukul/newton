### Example Solutions:

Find the solution n to the equation `n + 2 = 6`

        n+2=6
        n=6-2
        n=4
    
        So answer is the value of n is 4.


Solve the equation `8+2(n-4)=16`.
 
        First, we remove the parentheses and get
        8+2n-2*4=16 =>
        8+2n-8=16 =>
        2n=16 =>
        n=8
        
Solve the equation `3(n+15)=30+6n`.
 
        We first remove the parentheses on the left side and get =>
        3n+3⋅15=30+6n =>
        3n+45=30+6n
        
        We substract 3n from both sides and get =>
        45=30+3n
        
        We substract 30 from both sides and get =>
        15=3n
        
        By dividing both sides by 3, we get the final answer => 
        n=5. 
        
Second solution
        We divide both sides by 2 to get =>
        n+15=10+2n
        
        Substracting n from both sides, we get =>
        15=10+n
        
        The final answer is reached by substracting 10 from both sides. =>
        n=5

A number is equal to 7 times itself minus 18. Which is the number?

    The statement is equivalent to the following equation:

    x=7x−1
    18=7x−x
    6x=18
    x=3

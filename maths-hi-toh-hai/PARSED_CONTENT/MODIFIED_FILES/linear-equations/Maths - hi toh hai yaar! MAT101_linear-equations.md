        n+2=6
        n=6-2
        n=4
    
        So answer is the value of n is 4.

        First, we remove the parentheses and get
        8+2n-2*4=16 =>
        8+2n-8=16 =>
        2n=16 =>
        n=8

        We first remove the parentheses on the left side and get =>
        3n+3⋅15=30+6n =>
        3n+45=30+6n
        
        We substract 3n from both sides and get =>
        45=30+3n
        
        We substract 30 from both sides and get =>
        15=3n
        
        By dividing both sides by 3, we get the final answer => 
        n=5.

        Substracting n from both sides, we get =>
        15=10+n
        
        The final answer is reached by substracting 10 from both sides. =>
        n=5

    The statement is equivalent to the following equation:

    x=7x−1
    18=7x−x
    6x=18
    x=3

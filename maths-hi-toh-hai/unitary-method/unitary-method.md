# Unitary method

To understand Unitary method, watch this *video ([English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdz8OPbuBJM), [Hindi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56Cn9HgeyTM))*

By solving following *questions* try to understand how unitary method works. This is a really important concept that can help you to solve real-life problems as well as crack good entrance examinations :-)     

1. 16 men can build a wall in 56 hours. How many men will be required to do the same work in 32 hours?

        More the number of men, the faster will they build the wall.
        In 56 hours, the wall is built by 16 men.
        In 1 hour, the wall is built by 16 × 56 men.
        In 32 hours, the wall is built by (16 × 56)/32 men
        Therefore, in 32 hours, the wall is built by 28 men.


3. If 72 workers can do a piece of work in 40 days, in how many days will 64 workers complete the same work?

        Less workers will require more days to complete the work.
        72 workers can do the work in 40 days
        1 worker can do the same work in 72 × 40 days
        64 workers can do the same work in (72 × 40)/64
        Therefore, 64 workers can do the same work in 45 days.

1. 12 typists working for 4 hours to type a book in 18 days. In how many days, 4 typists will work for 8 hours to type same book?

        Solution:

        12 typists working for 4 hours type a book in 18 days
        1 typist working for 4 hours types a book in 18 × 12 days.
        1 typist working for 1 hour types a book in 18 × 12 × 4 days.
        4 typists working for 1 hour type a book in (18 × 12 × 4)/4
        4 typists working for 8 hours type a book in (18 × 12 × 4)/(4 × 8) days.
        Therefore, 4 typists working for 8 hours type a book in 27 days.

# Why Navgurukul and life at campuses

Life at our different campuses is vibrant and community based. We live, study and carry out the daily chores together. There are currently six campuses as mentioned below:

- Pune
- Bangalore
- Sarjapur
- Dharamshala
- Delhi
- Tripura


Please watch these videos for an overview of life at campuses. Then, we will go into details of the residential programmes at each of the campuses. (Pune/Bangalore/Sarjapur have simialr programmes hence, their information will be at one place together)

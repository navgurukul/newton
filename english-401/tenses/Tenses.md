Grammar tenses refer to the state of the verb. The state, or tense, of the verb explains the time of the action.

There are three major tenses in English. These include past, present, and future. Each of these tenses can explain an event that occurred in the past, an event that occurs in the present, or an event that will occur in the future.

Example of Past, Present, and Future Tenses:

I danced. (past)
I dance. (present)
I will dance. (future)

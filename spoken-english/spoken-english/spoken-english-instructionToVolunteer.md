It is divided into 15 Workshop Classes. We expect you to follow this Class division, to ensure that the sequence of learning is maintained, and a child has an opportunity to come back and attend only those specific classes she had doubts in, or had missed it for whatever reasons.

### Step 3 - Creating a Class
The next step is clearly to [Create a Class](https://www.merakilearn.org/class)! On this page, you'll find all the other classes created by other facilitators. You can recheck the date and time before creating your class, to ensure it doesn't clash with someone else's, and that your Classes are varied. Eg: Facilitator A creates *Class 1 - Introduction* on *Thursday, at 4pm*. Then you can create your Class 1 - Introduction on Saturday or Sunday, to space out similar sessions.

You can click on the Create a Class button on the left hand side corner, to create your class. (Please use the nomenclature mentioned in the above table)

Once you have completed creating a class. You shall get an email and/or a calendar invite. You may use that to join the Google Meet you've created for your class. You can use this [Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-admit-for-google-mee/epemkdedgaoeeobdjmkmhhhbjemckmgb/related?hl=en,) to Auto Admit students to the Meet you've scheduled.

**NOTE** : This will be a recusrive Session, meaning 1 volunteer will be teaching 5 students, and same students will be taught for the rest of the weeks as well to bring a cohort culture. 

The class conduct has to be done in following manner : 

For the people who are starting this week for the first session, please follow these steps:

While conducting classes via Meraki for spoken English, please limit the number of entries maximum to 15, when taking first class.

#### How to create classes:

1.This week, there would be a new way to setup your classes. While creating classes please Select "Cohort". While when you select cohort, as for eg if you have classes on Wednesday  , 4-5 pm, so scroll down after filling all you desc, email id, name etc, follow these steps.

2. check the checkbox **Weekly**

3. Check the checkboxes for **Days** on which you wish to conduct your classes eg, as in the above example, it is every *Wednesday*

Now you have either 2 options:

a. Either select **Until date** - please select the tentative date till which the course will get finished, eg as you are teaching English, considering 15-18 classes, and by calculation eg if your classes might end up by 18 December considering 15 weeks-18 weeks from August end, then in that section select 18 December.

b. Second option is to select **occurrences**, meaning total number of recurring classes, as english has total 15-18 including doubt sessions classes, so you can mention occurrences as 18 classes.

Please update the [Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jZYeO6412o1tFhmGVRjWETmotBMXZjK15CAiyy2Z0_c/edit#gid=0) (Add new data for each new class)

***FLOW OF SPOKEN ENGLISH:*** 
**PHASE-1: Building Comfort & Rapport**

First 5 weeks, make the students comfortable and familiarise (orientation class for assessing their levels, for introducing them to learning outcomes and approach). First 2-3 classes could be about team building related exercises, introductions, without any language correction.. just allow everyone to get comfortable in using whatever level of English they know without hesitation.

**PHASE -2:** **Usage of Elements of English**
Second 5 weeks, Grammar and language building. Each class will introduce one basic grammar topic and use exercises like fill in the blanks etc to test understanding. Can give one or two homework exercises. Take support from youtube videos, visual and interactive modes. Simple basic grammar topics and concepts to ensure students don't rote learn sentences. Here the learning outcome is to enable them to form sentences and convey their thoughts. **(*Please ensure to maintain code of conduct while sharing external media files and links)***

**PHASE-3:** **Building Fluency**

Last 5 weeks, This phase focusses on fluency, diction, pronunciation, pauses, comfort and confidence. Here the classes will have more and more of interaction and communication from the students. The idea is to get them to coherently form ideas and express in the language. Towards the end focus could be on discussion general interview topics or questions.
***Last class - Week 15 -Celebration of course completion, Certificate announcement (download), appreciation for completion, learning outcomes and feedback***

***Key Notes to be remembered while conducting these phases:***
1. The intent is to build their comfort, Spoken English and finally their fluency to be atleast interview ready.
2. Adding more vocabulary as and when required based on the pickup of students.

1. There might be a variation amongst the students with the level of their understanding and pickup, which is where volunteers need to amalgamate and process together.
2. Volunteers could routinely check with students if they are able to follow the content. 

### Step 4 - Classes with Students

1. Use the first five minutes to understand their learning journey on Meraki, and encourage them to self learn using Live Classes only as an extra help.
2. Use the next ten minutes to recapitulate and revise previous topics, and solve their previous queries.
3. You can use the second half of the class to share problems for the students to solve. It could be in the form of MCQs, True or False, Sentence Formation, or even Questions.
4. You can assign some homework or prework a student must do before the next class, such as the next topic they can read/ study and come for in the next class.
5. Keep checking in with the students if they've understood or no in between to ensure its a dialogue and not a monologue. You can try to make it as innovative and interactive as you wish to!

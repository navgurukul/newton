The objective of this activity is to introduce or revisit tenses SIMPLE TENSES.

What is a tense: A tense is a verb that helps us
understand time in grammar.
Past Tense - Things that already happened
Present Tense - Things that are happening now
Future Tense - Things that are going to happen.

The main function of a verb is to indicate when the action happens. There are three main verb tenses; 
past, present and future. Each tense is divided into; simple, continuous, perfect and perfect continuous. In this lesson, we will only focus on the simple tenses in the past, present and future.
The present tense of a verb is the 'original' form. The past tense can have different patterns. The future simple is formed with 'will'.

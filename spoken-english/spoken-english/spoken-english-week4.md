and the difference between who-what-when-where-why. 


### Game Time:
First, explain what is a tense, and the difference between the simple tenses - Past, Present, Future.
A tense is a verb that helps us understand time in grammar.
Past Tense - Things that already happened
Present Tense - Things that are happening now
Future Tense - Things that are going to happen.
TENSE GAME - Volunteer will state the word, and the student will attempt to form 3 sentences based on past - present - future. For students who need additional assistance, please use the following question prompts in the example below:

### Example: “Paint”
Past: What did you do yesterday? I painted yesterday
Present: What are you doing now? I am painting now
Future: What will you do tomorrow? I will paint tomorrow

Additional Regular Verbs to practice: Play, Cook, Ask, Climb, Push, Jump, Paint, Join, Try, Like
All regular verbs follow this pattern of Past tense ending in “ed”, Present ending in “ing” and Future by adding “will”. Irregular verbs do not follow this format. Provide an example and practice some irregular verbs, if the student is ready.
Example: “Run”
Past: What did you do yesterday? I ran yesterday
Present: What are you doing now? I am running now

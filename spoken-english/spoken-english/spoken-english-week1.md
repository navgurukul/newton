### Next 30 mins
1) About 10 mins
Describe a day in your life in this past week !
( Starting from when you woke up until the time you fall asleep )
First the volunteer describes the day !
Then the child describes the day !


2) About next 10 mins
GAME TIME : Be it an adult or a child, playing a game is always exciting !
Week 1 game is called “The Imitation Game”
This technique will help the children to enhance their pronunciation skills :)
Rules are very simple -
The child repeats after you. Understand the pace and break down the sentences
below accordingly. Also at any point if the child doesn’t understand the meaning of a word please define it.


### Short Story -

Short Story -

Ram and Sham were in a fight. Both of them said they owned the same mango tree.They went up to Birbal and asked him to decide the matter, once and for all.  Who was the true owner of the mango tree? 
Birbal said, "There is only one way to settle the matter. First, you must take all of the fruit off the tree.  Each of you should take half the mangos.  Then you must cut down the tree and divide the trunk in half.  Each of you should take half the wood, too.  Then everything will be fair.  That is what I say.”

Who really owned the mango tree?

Ram thought it was all a good idea, and he said so. 
But Sham said, “Your Honor! I have tended that tree for seven years. If you must, give the mango tree to Ram.  But do not make us cut it down!"
"What you have said to me is all I need to know," said Birbal.  Then he said that Sham was the true owner of the mango tree.


3) At the end of every session let’s teach them one word and their homework would be to try to use the word in a sentence when they talk to their friends/teachers in the school and make a note of how many times did they use it.

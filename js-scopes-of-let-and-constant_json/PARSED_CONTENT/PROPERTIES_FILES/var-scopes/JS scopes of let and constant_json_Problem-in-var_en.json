And you also felt that it is safe only but actually which is not. You can clearly see in the above example that after coming out of a block or after using atm still it knows your atm pin which is not secure. That happened only because of <span style=\"\">key</span>word var. So, we want something which holds your values for a particular block. This is where let can be used for."

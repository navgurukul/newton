	"Question2_key5": "A display named function is there, inside that we have 2 if blocks. In the first if we defined two <span style=\"\">variables</span> a and b with var and let <span style=\"\">key</span>words respectively.  After that in the second if block we are asking to print a and b.. Because var is defined inside a function, it has function scope and it is going to print its value 10, but in the case of let, let is declared in inside first if block because of let is a block scoped we are not able to access it in another if block, it given us reference <span style=\"\">error</span> b is not defined."

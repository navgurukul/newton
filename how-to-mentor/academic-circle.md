## Academic Circle
Every week, Wednesday 5 pm, just after the leave all the students are to assemble together for a common academic circle. Academic circle will focus on issues that the students are facing with respect to the studies.

For any such issues, proposals can be raised in the circle itself, which will be voted with - yes/no. The decisions will be taken by majority and will be implemented. This has to be coordinated by the TnP coordinator and DISCO.

## Learning Environment
A good learning environment that facilitates learning and questioning is crucial. Academic circles should take all the required steps to help create such a learning environment.

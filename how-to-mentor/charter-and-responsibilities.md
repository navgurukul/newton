    Every alternate week the mentor has to evaluate the students of some other group and update on three things:

    - Current level of the student
    - Are they happy with the progress of the student suggested by another mentor?

### One Video a Week
All the students have to create one video - and update the link of their video. Mentors will check the quality of the video and share the feedback with the student. All the mentors have to create one video each as well.

### One Class a Week
All the students have to take one class per week on any topic of their comfort. This will help them to articulate themselves better. They have to announce the class in the respective `_paathshala` group on Cliq. This is optional for the mentors.

[Project demo](https://employee-database-system.herokuapp.com/)

Description : We have to create a management system in which we can easily find out the employee names by entering their surnames or any alphabet of their names so it will show the employee details related to our search, and show the levels and salary of the employees.

Before writing the functions read this basic concept of Html which will help you to write the js file.

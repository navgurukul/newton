blockchain_key9=Important points:
blockchain_key10=A Blockchain is a type of double entry book keeping containing information about transactions.
blockchain_key11=Each transaction generates a hash.
blockchain_key12=A hash is a string of numbers and letters.
blockchain_key13=Transactions are entered in the order in which they occurred. Order is very important.
blockchain_key14=The hash depends not only on the transaction but the previous transaction's hash.
Even a small change in a transaction creates a completely new hash.
blockchain_key15=The nodes check to make sure a transaction has not been changed by inspecting the hash.

 If a transaction is approved by a majority of the nodes than it is written into a block.

blockchain_key16=Each block refers to the previous block and together make the Blockchain.
blockchain_key17=A Blockchain is effective as it is spread over many computers, each of which have a copy of the Blockchain.
blockchain_key18= These computers are called nodes.
blockchain_key19=The Blockchain updates itself every 10 minutes.

	"blockchain_key6": "Bitcoin is a digital and global money system currency. It allows people to send or\nreceive money across the internet, even to someone they don't know or don't trust. \nMoney can be exchanged without being linked to a real identity.\n",

	"blockchain_key10": "A Blockchain is a type of double entry book keeping containing information about transactions.\n",
	"blockchain_key11": "Each transaction generates a hash.\n",
	"blockchain_key12": "A hash is a `string` of numbers and letters.\n",
	"blockchain_key13": "Transactions are entered in the order in which they occurred. Order is very important.\n",
	"blockchain_key14": "The hash depends not only on the transaction but the previous transaction's hash.\nEven a small change in a transaction creates a completely new hash.\n",
	"blockchain_key15": "The nodes check to make sure a transaction has not been changed by inspecting the hash.\n\n If a transaction is approved by a majority of the nodes than it is written into a block.\n\n",
	"blockchain_key16": "Each block refers to the previous block and together make the Blockchain.\n",
	"blockchain_key17": "A Blockchain is effective as it is spread over many computers, each of which have a copy of the Blockchain.\n",
	"blockchain_key18": " These computers are called nodes.\n",
	"blockchain_key19": "The Blockchain updates itself every 10 minutes.\n\n\n\n",

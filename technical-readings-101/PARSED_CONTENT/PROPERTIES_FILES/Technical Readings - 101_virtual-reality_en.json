	"virtual-reality_key2": "Virtual reality (often just called VR) is the name for computer technology that makes a person feel like they are somewhere else. It uses software to produce images, sounds and other sensations to create a different place, so that a user feels like he or she is really a part of this other place. That other place can be a real place (to take a tour in another country, for instance) or imaginary (playing a game).\nMost current virtual reality environments are primarily visual experiences, displayed either on a computer screen or through special stereoscopic displays, but some simulations include additional sensory information, such as sound through speakers or headphones.\nThe simplest form of virtual reality is a 3-D image that can be explored interactively at a personal computer, usually by manipulating `keys` or the mouse so that the content of the image moves in some direction or zooms in or out. More sophisticated efforts involve such approaches as wrap-around display screens, actual rooms augmented with wearable computers, and haptics devices that let you feel the display images.\n",

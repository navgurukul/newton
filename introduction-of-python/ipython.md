## Now we will learn about iPython 

Here we will learn about, what is `ipython` and why do we use it?

When you write `python` on the Terminal, then *python shell* opens on the Terminal. You write your python code on the *python shell* to run it.
`iPython` also does the same work but it provides some extra features. Some of those features we will study below:

## Difference between `python` and `iPython`
### First with iPython 
First, on the Terminal write `ipython` and press *Enter*.
Now, write `cd Downloads` in it and press *Enter*.
Then write `ls` and press *Enter*.
You will be able to see all the **folder and files** that you kept under the Downloads folder.
Now to come outside the iPython shell write `quit` inside the shell and press **Enter**.


### Now we will do the same thing with python 

Write `ipython` on the `Terminal` and press **Enter**

Now write `cd Downloads` and press **Enter**.

```python
>>> cd Downloads
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    cd Downloads
               ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> 
```

You will be able to see something like this on the Terminal?
This means you cannot go to the **Downloads** folder with the help of  **python shell**.

For this, you need to come out of the **python shell** and for that, you need to type `quit` on the  **python shell**.

Now after coming outside type `cd Downloads` and then type  `ls` you will be able to see whatever is present in the Downloads.

You cannot change your **folder** by using a normal **python shell**. For that, you need to come out of the  **python shell**. But you can easily change the **folder** inside this python shell so that you don't need to come out of the **iPython shell**.

And when you will type in **python shell**.
```python
>>> if True:
... 
```
Then note that the cursor `(**|**) `comes without any space after this `...` .
But if you will type it in **iPython shell** then it will show like this.

```python
In [1]: if True:
   ...:     |
```
Then you will see that the cursor ` `(**|**)` comes after some spaces.
We call this **Indentation**. When you will write the code for the first time **50% error** will be there because of lack of **Indentation**.
Hence, iPython makes the life of an engineer very easy by providing extra features.

When iPython opens you can write code in it. If you are copy-pasting the code from somewhere then press `Ctrl + C` to copy-paste and open iPython and type `%paste` for pasting the code.


### Very Important Rules
- Run every example on `iPython shell`. If you don't do this you will make a fool of yourself.
- To copy-paste and run the code will not help you in understanding the code. You have to run every code by yourself.
- Words written in UPPER CASE or **bold letters** are very important. Learn them, you will come across them many times. 
- During the course You need to answer some questions at times. To answer those questions you can always upload a file.

### Some Code Samples

In this section, some code samples are given. To get comfortable with `iPython`, you can run them on `ipython`.

#### Example 1 :-

```python
print ("It will print this.")
print ("Cool Stuff "*10)
```

#### Example 2 :-

```python
time = input("Is it morning or evening? (morning/evening) ")
if time == "morning":
    print("Let's go for a run!")
elif time == "evening":
    print("Let's go out for a coffee.")
else:
    print("I did not understand what input you put?")
```

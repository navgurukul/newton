name: Learn to write Comments
```

We can write comments in any program . When we *run* the *program* these comments do not get *executed*.

Comments are written for our understanding ,and for the people who are working on that code with us or people with whom we will work later etc. For the understanding of all these people ,comments are used.
```python
print ("This will be printed.")
print ("This line will also be printed")
# This is a comment.
# You can write it for your ease.
# Any line that starts with "#" (hash) is called a  comment.
# We write these lines as programmers, for our own ease. Computer ignores them.
print ("Computer will not be able to read above comments,but will print this line.")
```

### What does your  program do, is very important to write in comments in a given technical language.
*Many times we have seen that the students who don't write comments properly during  interviews, they get a very negative feedback in interviews.*
**If you make this as a habit then your own  understanding will improve and in future you will not face any problem.**

## What is `Indentation`?

Please have a look at the code given below. Now think about the output of this code without running.
```python
a = 10
if a * 2 == 20:
print("Variable a when multiplied by 2 gives 20.")
else:
print("Variable a when multiplied by 2 does not give 20.")
```

What answer did you think? Please copy-paste this code, save this in a file and run this code. You will notice that this code will not print any output, but gives an `error`. To understand this error we need to think from the point of view of python. Python will run this program as follows:-

1. In the first line it will put the value `10` in "a".
2. In the second line python will check that whether multiplying **a** by `2` gives a result equal to 20 or not.
3. Till the third line python will be able to know that on multiplying **a** `2` by we will get `20`. But python gets confused at this place, it does not understand that whether it should only print  "Variable a when multiplied by 2 gives 20." or it needs to run the code given below also or not. Humans can easily understand this, but the computer gets mad and gives errors.

We will write this program correctly as follows,

```python
a = 10
if a * 2 == 20:
    print( )
else:
    print("Variable a when multiplied by 2 does not give 20.")
```

When python will run this correct code, then its brain will work like this. 

1. In the first line it will put the value `10` in "a".
2. In the second line python will check that whether multiplying **a** by `2` gives a result equal to 20 or not.
3. In the third line , python will print "Variable a when multiplied by 2 gives 20". Now, you will think that python prints this line in this code then why it did not print in the previous example. But, see a little care that the third line has started after some space. These `spaces` are called `indent` in python. Now, python understands that on multiplying  **a** by `2` we get `20`, if this condition is `True`, then we will run the lines which are `indented` below **if**.
4. In the 4th line python finds something else but it does not run else part because if the part already ran. So, how to use `if statement`, try to learn about this.

This spacing in python is called `indentation`. Whenever there is a problem related to `indentation`, Python calls it an `Indentation Error` This error looks like this:-

```python
  File "<ipython-input-5-9eaf99c4383b>", line 3
    print("a variable ko 2 se multiply kar ke 20 aata hai")
        ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```


### One more example

We will take more examples and understand them clearly. First, run the code given below. After that read the text given below.

#### Example :-
```python
counter = 1
while counter < 10:
    print("The counter is" + str(counter))
    counter = counter + 1
    print('--------')
``` 

In this program, in the last 3 lines ` (‘print "The counter is" + str(counter)’, ‘counter = counter + 1’, ‘print "--------"’) ` if there is no indentation then python will not be able to understand that after `while loop` what it has to run? Python will get confused and will give an error. To `indent` a python code is very important. If you see the program, you will realize that the code is divided into different parts:-

1. In the first part, the `counter` variable is defined and we write the line `while countering < 10`.
2. In the second part, we have written that code which will run after for `loop` again and again till the for `loop` is running. 
The different parts of code are called code blocks and in python to indent these blocks we use a tab. 
To understand this, save the given code in a new file and see what output comes and how that output is different from the output of the code given above. After this discussion about what happened?

#### Example:-
```python
counter = 1
while counter < 10:
    print("The counter is" + str(counter))
    counter = counter + 1
print('--------')
```

#### Note :-
 Whenever you write the code, then your editor should `indent` the code, but if it does not do that, then you can use the Tab key for `indenting`.

#### Note :- 
You can also use the Space key for `indentation`. `Space key`  is difficult to use, as many errors occur due to its use, just because of this many errors occur, that is why many Developers(Software Engineer) use Tab so that minor errors do not occur.

### Multiple Levels of `Indentation`

In a given `indented code block` there can be another indented code block. Study this code and understand and tell how the output comes? Try to run this code and see if you thought correctly about the output or not. If not then use your brain to think about it more.

```python
counter = 1
while counter < 10:
    if counter % 2 == 0:
        print("Counter is an even number.")
    print("The counter is" + str(counter))
    counter = counter + 1
print ('--------')
```

Please see here that in this code,  2 levels of indented code blocks exist.  

1. After the first level `if counter % 2 == 0’ is present.`
2. In the second level `print ("Counter is an even number.")` is present.

Here, python will run if under while loop  and `print ("Counter is an even number.")`only when inside the loop `counter` value is an even number.

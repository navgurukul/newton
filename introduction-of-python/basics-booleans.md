# What are Booleans ?

Booleans are  special type of constants, (till now we have studied about`Strings`, `Integers` and`Floats` ).

 Boolean values are of two types:

1. True 
2. False

These Boolean values help us in doing some interesting things. We can use them to do some really interesting work.

If any  variable is True then we tell the computer to do something and if it is False then we tell the computer to do something else.

As of know this much understanding is enough but we will study it in depth further :)

# Operators that give Boolean answers.

Whenever we ask any question to computer then we use some special type of operators to ask these questions. These operators always give answers in Boolean form i.e. either 'True or False '.All the operators are listed in the table given below.


| **Operator** | **Meaning**               | **Example**                                                                                                                 |
|:------------:|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <            | Which is lesser?            | 7 < 6 # False Why because 7 is greater than 6<br> 6 < 10 # True Because  6  is less than 10                                             |
| <=           | Which is less than equal to? | 7 <= 10 #True because 7 is less than 10 <br> 23 <= 23 # True because 23 is equal to 23 |
| ==           | Which is equal?          | varx = 10 <br> varx == 10 # True because varx is equal to 10 <br> 67 == 43 # False because 67 is not equal to 43|
| >=           | Which is greater than equal to?  | 56 >= 32 # True Because 56 is greater than 32  <br> 43 >= 70 # False because 43 is neither greater nor equal to 70 .          |
| >            | Which is greater?             | number1 = 43 <br> number1 > 20 # True because number1 contains value 43 which is greater than 20 .                           |
| !=           | Which is not equal to?     | 45 != 45 # False because 45 is equal to 45 <br> 45 != 34 # True because 45 is not equal to 34.                         |

Play with all these operators in Python shell. You will gain a better understanding.

```python
4 < 5 # True
```

```python
56 == 45 # False
```

If you will use these operators in Python shell then it will automatically show its Boolean answer.

	"WhatIsProgramming_key1": "name: What is Programming?\n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key2": "By giving **`instructions`** to the computer, we can make the computers solve complex problems.  \n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key3": "A set of **instructions** given to the computer is called a **`program`**.  \nThe Process of giving instructions to the computer is called **`programming`**.  \n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key4": "Doesn't it sound simple that we give instructions('program') to the computer and the computer follows these instructions to solve a complex problem. Giving instructions to the computer is called `programming`. :)  \n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key5": "But there is a small problem.  \n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key6": "Computers cannot understand our language like (Hindi, Tamil, Kannada). Computers can only understand the machine language, which is made of 0 and 1. Hence, it becomes difficult for us to communicate with computer in machine language.  \n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key7": "Then how can we give instructions to the computer ?  \n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key8": "Therefore, to solve this problem we made some languages like(**`Java`,  `Python`, `JavaScript`**) so that we can easily give instructions to the computer. Computers can easily convert these languages into machine language with the help of another `program` called `compiler`. \n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key9": "To give instructions to the computer, we need to learn any of these given languages. In this course, we are going to learn `python` language.  \n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key10": "We will use `python` language to give instructions to the computer.  \n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key11": "**Assignment**  \n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key12": "Have you ever given instructions to anybody or taken instructions from anybody. Can we call that a **program**?  \n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key13": "Search for `Python` language and its `applications`. How many people in the world use **`Java`**?\n"

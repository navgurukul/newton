	"WhatIsProgramming_key1": "By giving **instructions** to the computer,we can make the computers solve complex problems.\n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key2": "A set of **instructions** given to the computer is called a **program**.\nThe Process of giving instructions to the computer is called **programming**.\n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key3": "Doesn't it sound simple that we give instructions(program) to the computer and the computer follows these instructions to solve a complex problem? Giving instructions to the computer is called programming. :)\n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key4": "But there is a small problem.\n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key5": "Computers cannot understand our language like (Hindi, Tamil,  Kannada). Computers can only understand the machine language which is made of 0 and 1. So, it becomes difficult for us to communicate with the computer in machine language.\n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key6": "Then how can we give instructions to the computer?\n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key7": "Therefore, to solve this problem we made some languages like(Java, `Python`, JavaScript) so that we can easily give instructions to the computer. Computers can easily convert these languages into machine language with the help of “another program called a `compiler`.”\n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key8": "To give instructions to the computer we need to learn any of these given languages. In this course, we are going to learn the `python` language.\n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key9": "We will use `python` language to give instructions to the computer.\n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key10": "**Assignment**\n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key11": "Have you ever given instructions to anybody or taken instructions from anybody. Can we call that a **program**?\n",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key12": "  Search for `Python` language and its `applications`? How many people in the world use Java?\n"

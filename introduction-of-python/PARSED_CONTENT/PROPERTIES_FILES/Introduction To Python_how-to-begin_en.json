	"how-to-begin_key1": "Anyone can do anything in this video is just related to this\n",
	"how-to-begin_key2": "How to begin this course?\n",
	"how-to-begin_key3": "How to use `Python`? Please see this video to understand.\n",
	"how-to-begin_key4": "When you will move forward in this course, you will find examples of `python` `code` in different ways. You have to run these examples on **`python` `shell`**.\n",
	"how-to-begin_key5": "Open **`python` `shell`** in your laptop.\n",
	"how-to-begin_key6": "Select the `code` given above, press `Ctrl + C` together so that the `code` will be copied and then you can go to the `terminal` and paste this `code` by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + V` on the `terminal`.\n",
	"how-to-begin_key7": "If you will run this `code` line by line, you will be able to understand the `code` line by line.\n",
	"how-to-begin_key8": "This complete `code` is doing 4-5 different tasks, how can we break this `code` into parts and understand it, this method is given below and it is going to help you in the future.\n",
	"how-to-begin_key9": "This is the first line, run this line on the `terminal`, you will be able to see something on the `terminal`.\n",
	"how-to-begin_key10": "Please run this second `code` on the `Terminal` and see what happens there?\n",
	"how-to-begin_key11": "Now run this line separately on the  `Terminal` and see what happens there?\n",
	"how-to-begin_key12": "Now copy-paste this `code` together on the  `Terminal` and see what happens there?\n",
	"how-to-begin_key13": "What is happening in this line, you will be able to understand later? But run this `code` and try to understand.\n",
	"how-to-begin_key14": "Copy-paste this on `Terminal` and to stop this press  `Ctrl + C`  together on the `Terminal`.\n",
	"how-to-begin_key15": "Now run this `code` and try to identify the difference between the `code` given above and below.\n",
	"how-to-begin_key16": "Now run this `code` together and to stop this `code` what will you do?\n",
	"how-to-begin_key17": "Now think that what will you do to stop the `code` given above?\n",
	"how-to-begin_key18": "Similarly, in this way, only `codes` will be written in the whole course. You will be required to run the `code` this way only. To run this `code` you need to open an `application` named `Terminal` on your laptop. After opening it, you need to type the `python` `code` and then run it.\n",
	"how-to-begin_key19": "Very Important Rules\n",
	"how-to-begin_key20": "`Execute` each example on **`python` `shell`**. If you are not doing this you are making a fool of yourself.\n",
	"how-to-begin_key21": "By copy-pasting the `code`, you will not be able to understand it properly. You should write each `code` by yourself and then run it.\n",
	"how-to-begin_key22": "Words written in `UPPER CASE` or **bold letters** are very important. Learn them, you will come across them many times.\n",
	"how-to-begin_key23": "During the course you need to answer some questions at many places. To give answers you can `upload` the `file`.\n"

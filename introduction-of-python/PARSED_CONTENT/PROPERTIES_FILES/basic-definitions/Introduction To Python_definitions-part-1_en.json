	"definitions-part-1_key9": "Another example, if we want to go to the market ,this is a program and the way/route we follow to go to  the market is called programming.\n",

	"definitions-part-1_key15": "In the process of making tea.\n",
	"definitions-part-1_key16": "Like first we take a bowl ,add water , sugar ,tea leaves and milk  then boil it, hence the tea is prepared. Similarly to do computer  programming we need to follow some rules which we will study today.\n",

	"definitions-part-1_key18": "12\n",
	"definitions-part-1_key19": "In this  example we are adding a and b, here to add  is a process and this process is called programming. Whatever work we do, the process of doing that work is called programming.\n",

	"definitions-part-1_key25": " Just as we can understand English but computers cannot understand English. Computer understands  0 and 1 .\n",

	"definitions-part-1_key32": "`Syntax` is just like `python` grammar. It is a set of rules that tells how to write and run a `python` `code`.\n",
	"definitions-part-1_key33": "`Example`\n",
	"definitions-part-1_key34": " Suppose you have written (`Python` awesome) in English , do you think that it is grammatically correct or is there anything missing?\nYes, you are correct, this sentence is grammatically wrong  (`python` is awesome ) this sentence is correct , just as in English, there are certain rules of grammar similarly to write some  `python` `code` some `syntax` rule  are there ,like while writing `code`  if we forget to put any symbol, Col√≥n(:) or parenthesis  () etc, then it will display a message of `syntax` `error`.\n",

	"definitions-part-1_key40": "In this  example you saw that while printing I forgot to put one parenthesis ,as a result of this it is showing `syntax` `error`.\n",
	"definitions-part-1_key41": "### Algorithm\n\n\n",
	"definitions-part-1_key42": "Algorithm is a step by step process to solve any problem. With the help of this we break the problem into smaller parts and then solve it. It can also be defined as a procedure or formula to solve any \n problem or task.\n",
	"definitions-part-1_key43": "`Example :`\n",
	"definitions-part-1_key44": "If we want to make cookies ,so first we collect all the ingredients and then we will make it step by step, if we miss any step then cookies would not be tasty or good.\n",
	"definitions-part-1_key45": "To make tea first of all we will take\n",
	"definitions-part-1_key46": "a bowl \nthen water\nSugar and tea leaf\nmilk\n",
	"definitions-part-1_key47": "As you saw above that we have made a list of ingredients required to make tea i.e. we have collected all the things to make tea .This is called algorithm, here we have taken things step by step.\n",

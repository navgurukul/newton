	"ipython_key2": "Here we will learn about, what is `ipython` and why do we use it?\n",
	"ipython_key3": "When you write `python` on the `Terminal`, then *`python` `shell`* opens on the `Terminal`. You write your `python` `code` on the *`python` `shell`* to run it.\n`iPython` also does the same work but it provides some extra features. Some of those features we will study below:\n",
	"ipython_key4": "Difference between `python` and `iPython`\n",
	"ipython_key5": "First with `iPython`\n",
	"ipython_key6": "First, on the `Terminal` write `ipython` and press *Enter*.\nNow, write `cd Downloads` in it and press *Enter*.\nThen write `ls` and press *Enter*.\nYou will be able to see all the **folder and `files`** that you kept under the Downloads folder.\nNow to come outside the `iPython` `shell` write `quit` inside the `shell` and press **Enter**.\n",
	"ipython_key7": "Now we will do the same thing with `python`\n",
	"ipython_key8": "Write `ipython` on the `Terminal` and press **Enter**\n",
	"ipython_key9": "Now write `cd Downloads` and press **Enter**.\n",
	"ipython_key10": "You will be able to see something like this on the `Terminal`?\nThis means you cannot go to the **Downloads** folder with the help of  **`python` `shell`**.\n",
	"ipython_key11": "For this, you need to come out of the **`python` `shell`** and for that, you need to type `quit` on the  **`python` `shell`**.\n",
	"ipython_key12": "Now after coming outside type `cd Downloads` and then type  `ls` you will be able to see whatever is present in the Downloads.\n",
	"ipython_key13": "You cannot change your **folder** by using a normal **`python` `shell`**. For that, you need to come out of the  **`python` `shell`**. But you can easily change the **folder** inside this `python` `shell` so that you don't need to come out of the **`iPython` `shell`**.\n",
	"ipython_key14": "And when you will type in **`python` `shell`**.\n",
	"ipython_key15": "Then note that the cursor `(**|**) `comes without any space after this `...` .\nBut if you will type it in **`iPython` `shell`** then it will show like this.\n",
	"ipython_key16": "Then you will see that the cursor ` `(**|**)` comes after some spaces.\nWe call this **`Indentation`**. When you will write the `code` for the first time **50% `error`** will be there because of lack of **`Indentation`**.\nHence, `iPython` makes the life of an engineer very easy by providing extra features.\n",
	"ipython_key17": "When `iPython` opens you can write `code` in it. If you are copy-pasting the `code` from somewhere then press `Ctrl + C` to copy-paste and open `iPython` and type `%paste` for pasting the `code`.\n",

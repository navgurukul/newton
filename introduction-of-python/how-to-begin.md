How to use Python? Please see this video to understand.

When you will move forward in this course, you will find examples of python code in different ways. You have to run these examples on **python shell**.

Open **python shell** in your laptop.
```sh
$ python
```

```python

print("This line will be printed in python.")
print("This,another line will also be printed in python")
print(2 + 5)
i = 0
print(i)
while i < 100:
    print("I will be printed again and again.:)")

```
Select the code given above, press `Ctrl + C` together so that the code will be copied and then you can go to the terminal and paste this code by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + V` on the terminal.

If you will run this code line by line, you will be able to understand the code line by line.

This complete code is doing 4-5 different tasks, how can we break this code into parts and understand it, this method is given below and it is going to help you in the future.


This is the first line, run this line on the terminal, you will be able to see something on the `terminal`.
```python
print("This line will be printed in python.")
```

Please run this second code on the Terminal and see what happens there?
```python
print("This, another line will also be printed in python")
```

Now run this line separately on the  Terminal and see what happens there?
```python
print(2 + 5)
```

Now copy-paste this code together on the  Terminal and see what happens there?
```python
print("This line will be printed in python.")
print("This, another line will also be printed in python")
print(2 + 5)
```

What is happening in this line, you will be able to understand later? But run this code and try to understand.
```python
i = 0
print(i)
```

Copy-paste this on Terminal and to stop this press  `Ctrl + C`  together on the Terminal.
```python
i = 0
while i < 100:
    print("I will be printed again and again.:)"
```

Now run this code and try to identify the difference between the code given above and below.
```python
i = 0
while i < 100:
    print("I will be printed again and again:)")
    i = i+1
```


Now run this code together and to stop this code what will you do?
```python
print("This line will be printed in python.")
print("This, another line will also be printed in python")
print(2 + 5)
i = 0
print (i)
while i < 100:
    print("I will be printed again and again.:)")
```
Now think that what will you do to stop the code given above?

Similarly, in this way, only codes will be written in the whole course. You will be required to run the code this way only. To run this code you need to open an application named `Terminal` on your laptop. After opening it, you need to type the python code and then run it.


## Very Important Rules

- Execute each example on **python shell**. If you are not doing this you are making a fool of yourself.
- By copy-pasting the code, you will not be able to understand it properly. You should write each code by yourself and then run it.
- Words written in `UPPER CASE` or **bold letters** are very important. Learn them, you will come across them many times.
- During the course you need to answer some questions at many places. To give answers you can upload the file.

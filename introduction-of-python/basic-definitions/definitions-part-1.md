## Basic Definitions


### Program


**A set of instructions is called a program.**

#### Example :-

```python
a = 5
b = 9
print(a+b)
 ```
### Output :-

`14` 

### `Real Life Example :-`

For example if we want to make tea ,we will first collect all the ingredients required to make tea like sugar, tea leaves, milk, these are all the instructions that tell what is needed to make tea.

Another example, if we want to go to the market, this is a program and the way/ route we follow to go to  the market is called programming.

### Programming

The process of doing any work is called `programming`.

### Example :-

In the process of making tea.

Like first we take a bowl ,add water, sugar, tea leaves and milk then boil it, hence the tea is prepared. Similarly to do computer programming we need to follow some rules which we will study today.

### Example :-
```python
a = 5
b = 7
print(a+b)
 ```
### Output :-

`12`

In this example we are adding a and b, here to add  is a process and this process is called programming. Whatever work we do, the process of doing that work is called programming.

### `High Level Language`

High level language is that language that humans can easily understand but computers cannot.

`Example`

 Just as we can understand English but computers cannot understand English. Computer understands  0 and 1 .


### `Low Level Language`

Low level language is also called  machine language which is made of 1 or 0, humans cannot understand low level language but computers can easily understand.

### `Syntax` 

`Syntax` is just like python grammar. It is a set of rules that tells how to write and run a python code.

### Example :-

 Suppose you have written (Python awesome) in English , do you think that it is grammatically correct or is there anything missing?
Yes, you are correct, this sentence is grammatically wrong  (python is awesome ) this sentence is correct , just as in English, there are certain rules of grammar similarly to write some  python code some syntax rule  are there ,like while writing code  if we forget to put any symbol, Colón(:) or parenthesis  () etc, then it will display a message of syntax error.

### Example :-

```python
num = 5
print(num
 ```
### Output :-

`Syntax Error: unexpected EOF while parsing`

```python
num = 5
print "a"
 ```
### Output :-

`Syntax Error: invalid syntax`

In this example you saw that while printing I forgot to put one parenthesis, as a result of this it is showing syntax error.


### `Algorithm`

Algorithm is a step by step process to solve any problem. With the help of this we break the problem into smaller parts and then solve it. It can also be defined as a procedure or formula to solve any problem or task.

### Example :-

- If we want to make cookies ,so first we collect all the ingredients and then we will make it step by step, if we miss any step then cookies would not be tasty or good.


- To make tea first of all we will take

- a bowl 
- then water
- Sugar and tea leaf
- milk

As you saw above that we have made a list of ingredients required to make tea i.e. we have collected all the things to make tea. This is called algorithm, here we have taken things step by step.

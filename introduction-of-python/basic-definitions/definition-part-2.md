### Binary Numbers

`Binary numbers` are known as machine language or low level language, binary numbers are made of 0 and 1 which humans cannot understand but computers can.

### `Interpreter` 

It checks the code line by line and the line at which error is present, interpreter  stops the code at that line and shows the name of error.
`Interpreter`  converts high level language to low level language with the help of which the computer is able to run the code.

**Interpreter is used for Python and Ruby programming languages.**

#### Example :-

```python
a = megha
print(a)
 ```
#### Output :-
`file "<string>",line 1, in <module>`

In  this example you saw that I have taken a variable named **a** and assigned/given  a string value to it but I forgot to put " "(quote). So, python was not able to identify the type of value I gave to the variable **a**. Therefore, the interpreter stopped the code at the line that contained error, and displayed the error.

### `Compiler`

`Compiler` is a software that scans the complete code in one go and if the code contains any error, then it shows the error at the end of the code.
Whereas the `interpreter`, stops the code at the line that contains error.

**Compiler is used in C and C++ programming languages.**

### `Case Sensitive `

Case sensitive means that the text that we have typed should be exactly same as we type it anywhere in the code.

#### Example :- 

```python
var = 5
print(Var)
 ```
#### Output :-

`Var is not defined`

For example ,in the above example ,we have assigned a  variable named **var** and while printing we typed **Var**, so an error was displayed because in python var and Var are different. In python small letters and capital letters are considered different.

### `Error/ Bugs`

When we make any mistake while writing the code, that mistake is called error/bug.

#### Example :-

```python
num = 5
print(num
 ```
#### Output :-

`SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing`
#### Example :-
```python
num=5
print "a"
 ```
### Output :-

`SyntaxError: invalid syntax`


In this example you saw that while printing I forgot to put parenthesis so it showed us a syntax error which means our code has some mistake/error.

### Debugs

Debug means to solve bug/error in the given code or removing the error from the code and writing the correct code which is as per the syntax.

#### Example :-

```python
num=5
print(num)
 ```
### Output :-

`5`

#### Example :-
```python
num=2
Print (num)
 ```
### Output :-

`2`

As you saw in the bug example   there was a bug present in the second code so we debugged that code.

### `Source code`

Source code is that code which humans can easily understand.

### Example :-
```python
name = "python"
print(name)
 ```
### Output :-

`python`

In this example you saw that we have taken a variable named as **name** and we have stored python in it.Ypu can easily read and understand this code .This code is called `source code/ main code`.

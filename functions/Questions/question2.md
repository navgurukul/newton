## Question 2 

Perfect Number?
A perfect number is the one which is equal to the sum of all it's factors(including 1 and excluding itself).

Define a function named perfect() which takes one argument(integer) and checks if it is a perfect number or not. Now use this code to write a program that prints all the perfect numbers between 1-1000. 

`Example:-`


 6 ek perfect number hai 6=1+2+3.
 
`Expected Output :- `

6,28,496

## Question 4

This question is in 2 parts. Submit the code of both the parts by writing them in the same file.


### Question (Part 1)

Write a function named `add_numbers` which takes two numbers as arguments and then prints their sum. The name of the arguments should be `number1` and `number2`.


`Input :-`

```python 
# Write add_numbers function here
num1 = 56
num2 = 12
add_numbers(num1,num2)
 ```

**Output :-**
68


## Question (Part 2)

Write a function named `add_numbers_list` which takes 2 lists of two integers and then prints the sum of the integers with the same position.

Use the add_numbers function given in Part 1 to count 2 integers that have the same position.

If we give [50, 60, 10] and [10, 20, 13] to this function it will print this

## Question 5

This question is in 2 parts. Submit the code of both the parts by writing them in the same file.

###  Question (Part 1)

Write a function named `check_numbers` which takes two numbers and then print "both are even" if both numbers are even (divide by 2) otherwise print "both numbers are not even".


###  Question (Part 2)

Now write a function named `check_numbers_list` Which takes the list of an integer as a argument and then checks whether both the integers with the same index are even or not.

To check this, use the `check_numbers` function written in the previous `Part 1`.

If you call your function `[2, 6, 18, 10, 3, 75]` and `[6, 19, 24, 12, 3, 87]` then it should give this output:


both are even
---------------
both are not even
---------------
both are even
---------------
both are even
---------------
both are not even
---------------
both are not even

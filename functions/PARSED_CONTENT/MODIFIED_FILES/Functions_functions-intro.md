![](assets/function_defn_inst_1.png)
2. The code of this function (two lines to print) is written under `def definition_say_hello()`by giving some indent (space)functions-intro_key20

**Output :-**


It was fun meeting  withyou. 
Bye bye
It was fun meeting with you. 
Bye bye
PPython is used a lot.
It was fun meeting with you.
Bye bye
It was fun meeting with you.
Bye bye

1. We create functions in python by using the def keyword. After def the name of the function, function_say_bye is written. After the name we put two brackets ( ).
2. The brackets are followed by a colon :. The python semicolon understands that the code of the function is starting.
3. See that the entire function's code is written with an indent (space). Python understand that this is the code inside the function.
4. The code after print print ("Bye bye") is written without space. Python understand that the code of block function has finished.
5. Functions are also named according to the naming rules of variables.
Once memorize the naming rules of variables.

## Understand the Function Call 

Write the code below and see if any output is coming from it. If the output is not come then why is it not coming?

```
```python
def definition_hello_again():
    print("Again Hello :)")
    print("How are you?")
 ```

functions-intro_key24


```python
def definition_hello_again():
    print("Again Hello :)")
    print("How are you?")
definition_hello_again()
 ```

## Question 2

Write a function named `function_print_lines` which takes 2 strings, and prints them in the following manner.

If we give these 2 arguments - `"My name is Rishabh."` and `"I am the co-founder of NavGurukul"`
we will get the following output:

```python 
# write your function here

#  -output 
# My name is Rishabh..
# I am the co-founder of NavGurukul.
```

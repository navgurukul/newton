## Mentor : Mentee System

## Mentor

**A mentor is a student who guides another student by building trust and modeling positive behaviors. An effective mentor understands that her role is to be like a teacher, a motivator, a role model, an advisor and should be a very strong support system to the mentee.**

 At Navgurukul,
- A mentor should be allotted to new students to help them in their studies.
- A mentor should give at least 1 hour daily.
- A mentor should take interviews of their mentee by the end of the week.
- After taking the interview, the mentor should update the Progress Tracker sheet for her mentee based on her mentee’s interview performance.
- For the interview, the mentor can also ask her mentee to make a presentation/ video of that given topic.
- This progress Tracker Sheet is handled by TNP’s(Training and Placement Coordinators).
- If the mentee feels that her mentor needs to work or improve her explanation skills then the mentor can ask her mentee to take a class with lots of real-life examples on the given topic. This will not only improve their explanation skills but also help in boosting her confidence.


**The selection process of a mentor is not very specific, any student can become a mentor if she completes her topics and can handle their mentees’ academics effectively. Every student has to become a mentor either weak or strong.**

## Benefits of mentoring for Mentors:-

- Boosts self-confidence.
- Builds self-awareness.
- Develops Leadership skills.
- Communication skills and learn the art of    giving feedback to mentees.
- Learn the art of asking questions.
- Becomes an active listener.

## Mentee

**The mentee is the student who learns from the mentors and utilizes that knowledge to complete that particular topic and also further studies.**

So, here in Navgurukul, there is a Mentor/Mentee Tree designed where it's shown who is the mentor of whom.

## Question 3

Below is a program in which the `keys` are between `1 to 15` and the values ​​are the squares of the keys.

The output should be something like this:-
`
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64,
9: 81, 10: 100, 11: 121, 12: 144, 13: 169, 14: 196, 15: 225}`

Now, you have to `debug` this :-

```python
c=dict()
for i in range(1,16):
	c=i*i
print(c) 
 ```

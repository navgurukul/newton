Below is a program in which the keys are between 1 to 15 and the values ​​are the squares of the keys.

The output should be something like this:-

```
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81, 10: 100, 11: 121, 12: 144, 13: 169, 14: 196, 15: 225} 
 ```

Now you have to fix this program.

```python
c=dict()
for i in range(1,16):
	c=i*i
print(c) 
 ```

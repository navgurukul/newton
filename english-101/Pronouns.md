The word that is used in place of nouns is called Pronoun. ( Noun के बदले आए हुए शब्द को pronoun कहते है। )


Lets take an example and see the difference. Take a look below to sentences:
1) Rahul is absent because Rahul is ill. (राहुल अनुपस्थित है क्योंकि राहुल बीमार है। )
2) Rahul is absent because he is ill. (राहुल अनुपस्थित है क्योंकि वह बीमार है। )


In the first sentence, proper noun 'Rahul' has been repeatedly used, whereas the use of *he* (pronoun) in the second sentence looks better in comparison to first sentence.

(पहले वाक्य मे बार-बार  राहुल उपयोग हो रहा है, दूसरे वाक्य मे राहुल की जगह पर *"वह"* उपयोग हो रहा है। )

## What are Operators?

We use `operators` to perform some operation (calculation or change in the value of) between variables. Just like '+' in maths is an addition operator, similarly there are `operators` in Python.

#### Example :-

```python
a=6
b=5
print(a+b)
```
#### Output :-

`11`

In the above example, we have added the values of the variables `a` and `b` with the help of `+` that is `addition operator`.
Here, a and b are the operands while `+` is the `operator`, so the variables that are used with an `operator` are called `operands`.

Let's consider different logical `operators` that are used in `python` programming.\n",
	"Logical_key4": "(Logical `operators` help us to take decisions and make sure the required conditions are met to proceed.)\n",
	"Logical_key5": "`and :-` This `operator` is used to check that both the conditions it operates on must be `true`. If both the conditions are `true`, ***`and`*** will return `true`, otherwise (even if 1 condition is `false` or both conditions are `false`), the `output` will be `false`. Example : I want apples and oranges to make a fruit salad. Here, only one of them will not complete my salad, I want both.\n",

For Example,\n`1 and 2` gives the `output` as 2 because when checking if both conditions are correct, the `output` or answer of `and` can be determined when it has checked the second condition.\nSimilarly, for `0 and 2` the `output` is 0 as at the time of checking the first condition, the answer of the `and` `operator` is determined to be `false` since the first condition is `false`.**\n",

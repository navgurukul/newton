This means that it will only give you the quotient of division until the number can be divided. It follows the rule:-\n`Dividend = Quotient x Divisor + Remainder`. So, in floor division the answer for `3//2 is 1` and `5//8 is 0`. It does not go into decimal and only gives you the highest quotient. You can think of it like division when you first learned it, you did not know how to divide with decimals so you only calculated the answer until the number could be divided.\n",

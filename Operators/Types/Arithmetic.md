## ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

We use `arithmetic operators` just like we do in mathematics, to perform common calculations with numeric values (numbers).

| OPERATORS     | NAME | EXAMPLE    |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| `+` | `Addition`   |  `2 + 5`  |
|`-`  | `Subtraction` | `2 - 5`   |
|`*`  | `Multiply`    |`2 * 5`    |
|`/`  | `Division`   | `2 / 5`   |
| `%` | `Modulus`    | `2 % 5`   |
| `**`| `Exponents`   |`2 ** 5`   |
| `//`| `Floor Division` | `2 // 5`|


### `Addition(+) :-`

  The `addition operator (+)` is used to add or calculate the sum of values. 

#### Example :-
```python
x=25
y=10
print(x+y)
```

#### Output :-

35


### `Subtraction(-):-`
 The `subtraction operator (-)` is used to subtract or calculate the difference in values.

#### Example :-
```python
var1=5
var2=3
print(var1-var2)
```
#### Output :-

2


### `Multiply(*) :-`
 The `multiplication operator (*)` is used to multiply or calculate the product of values.

#### Example :-
```python
a=2
b=3
print(a*b)
```
#### Output :-

6


#### Now you know how ARITHMETIC OPERATORS work and How do we get output in python. Do you know how the computer gives us the output? If don't watch this video

### `Division(/):-`
 The `division operator (/)` is used to divide or calculate the quotient of division of values.

#### Example :-
```python
x=5
y=2
print(x/y)
```
#### Output :-

2.5

### `Modulus(%) :-`
The `modulus operator (%)` is used to find the remainder of division of one value by another. It gives you only the remainder and not the quotient of division.

#### Example :-
```python
num=5
num1=2
print(num%num1)
```
#### Output :-

1

### `Exponents(**) :-`
 The `exponent/exponentiation operator (**)` is used to raise one number to the power of the value of the second number such that 2 raised to the power of 3 which is 8 will be written as `2**3`.

#### Example :-
```python
x=2
y=5
print(x**y)
```
#### Output :-

32


### `Floor Division(//) :-`
 The `floor division operator (//)` is used to calculate the largest integer quotient of a division. This means that it will only give you the quotient of division until the number can be divided. It follows the rule:-
`Dividend = Quotient x Divisor + Remainder`. So, in floor division the answer for `3//2 is 1` and `5//8 is 0`. It does not go into decimal and only gives you the highest quotient. You can think of it like division when you first learned it, you did not know how to divide with decimals so you only calculated the answer until the number could be divided.

#### Example :-
```python
a=15
b=2
print(a//b)
```
#### Output :-

7

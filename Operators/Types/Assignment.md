## `ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS`

`Assignment operators` are used to assign values to variables. They ultimately give the value on the right of the operator to the variable on the left.

| OPERATOR | NAME | EXAMPLE |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| `=` | `Assignment` | `x=5` |
| `+=` | `Add And` | `x+=5 or x=x+5` |
| `-=` | `Subtract And` | `x-=5 or x=x-5` |
| `*=` | `Multiply And` | `x*=5 or x=x*5` |
| `/=` | `Division And` | `x/=5 or x=x/5` |
| `//=` | `Floor Division And ` | `x//=5 or x=x//5` |
| `%=` | `Modulus And` | `x%=5 or x=x%5` |
| `**=` | `Exponent And` | `x**=5 or x=x**5` |

### `Assignment Operator(=) :-`

The `asignment operator(=)` assigns values to the left hand operand from the right side operand. (This operator gives the value of the operand on the right to the operand on the left).
(Operands are values that any operator works/operates on).

#### Example :-
```python
x=5
print(x)
```
#### Output :-

5

### `Add AND Operator(+=) :-`
   
`Add AND Operator (+=)` adds the value of right operand to the value of left hand operand and then gives the sum (result of addition) to the left operand. Here, `a+=b is the same as a=a+b`.

#### Example :-
```python
x=5
y=10
x+=y
print(x)
```

#### Output :-

15


### `Subtract AND Operator(-=) :-`
   
`Subtract AND Operator (-=)` subtracts the value of the right operand from the left side operand and gives the result to the left operand. Here, `a-=b is the same as a=a-b`.

#### Example :-
```python
x=10
y=5
x-=y
print(x)
```

#### Output :-

5


### `Multiply AND Operator(*=) :-`

`Multiply AND Operator (*=)` multiplies the left hand operand with the right hand operand and returns the value as output, that is gives the result to the left hand operand. Here, `a*=b is the same as a=a*b`.

#### Example :-
```python
x=5
y=10
x*=y
print(x)
```

#### Output :-

50

### `Division AND Operator(/=) :-`
   
`Divide AND Operator (/=)` divides the left hand operand with the right hand operand value and gives the result, that is gives the value to the left hand side operand.Here, `a/=b is the same as a=a/b`.

#### Example :-
```python
x=50
y=10
x/=y
print(x)
```

#### Output :-

5

### `Modulus AND Operator(%=) :-`

`Modulus AND Operator (%=)` divides the value of left hand operand with the right hand one and the reminder of this division becomes the new value of the left hand side operand, that is it is given to the left hand side operator. Here, `a%=b is the same as a=a%b`.

#### Example :-
```python
x=25
y=10
x/=y
print(x)
```

#### Output :-

5

### `Exponent AND Operator(**=) :-`

`Exponent Operator` gives us the exponentiated value of the left hand operand when raised to the power of the value found on the right hand side. This value is then given to the left hand side operand. Here, `a**=b is the same as a=a**b`.
 
#### Example :-
```python
x=5
y=2
x**=y
print(x)
```

#### Output :-

25

### `Floor Division AND(//=) :-`

`Floor division AND(//=)` divides the value found in the left hand side with the value of the right hand side operand. The integer value becomes the left hand operand value. This means that the integer part of the quotient of division is given to the left hand side operand and it it contains the decimal part, it is ignored. Here, `a//=b is the same as a=a//b`.

#### Example :-
```python
x=5
y=2
x//=y
print(x)
```

#### Output :-

2

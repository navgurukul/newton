The crop() method on Image objects takes a box tuple and returns an Image object representing the cropped image. The cropping does not happen in place—that is, the original Image object is left untouched, and the crop() method returns a new Image object. Remeber that a boxed tuple—in this case, the cropped section—includes the left column and top row of pixels but only goes up to and does not include the right column and bottom row of pixels."

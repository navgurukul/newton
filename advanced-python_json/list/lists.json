Lists and tuples can contain multiple values, which makes it easier to write programs that handle large amounts of data. And since lists themselves can contain other lists, you can use them to arrange data into hierarchical structures."

The term list value refers to the list itself (which is a value that can be stored in a <span style=\"\">variable</span> or passed to a function like any other value), not the values inside the list value. A list value looks like this: ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']. Just as <span style=\"\">string</span> values are typed with quote characters to mark where the <span style=\"\">string</span> begins and ends, a list begins with an opening square bracket and ends with a closing square bracket, []. Values inside the list are also called items. Items are separated with commas (that is, they are comma-delimited). For example, enter the following into the interactive <span style=\"\">shell</span>:"

We search the inbox for messages received on a specific date and store the returned message IDs in UIDs ❷. Calling delete</i>message() and passing it UIDs returns a dictionary; each <span style=\"\">key</span>-value pair is a message ID and a tuple of the message’s flags, which should now include \\Deleted ❸. Calling expunge() then permanently deletes messages with the \\Deleted flag and returns a success message if there were no problems expunging the emails. Note that some email providers, such as Gmail, automatically expunge emails deleted with delete_messages() instead of waiting for an expunge command from the IMAP client."

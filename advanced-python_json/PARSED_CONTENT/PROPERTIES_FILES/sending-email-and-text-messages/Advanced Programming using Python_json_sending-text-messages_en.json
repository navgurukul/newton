Store your account SID in accountSID and your auth token in authToken and then call TwilioRestClient() and pass it accountSID and authToken. The call to TwilioRestClient() returns a TwilioRestClient object ❷. This object has a messages attribute, which in turn has a create() method you can use to send text messages. This is the method that will instruct Twilio’s servers to send your text message. After storing your Twilio number and cell phone number in myTwilioNumber and myCellPhone, respectively, call create() and pass it <span style=\"\">key</span>word arguments specifying the body of the text message, the sender’s number (myTwilioNumber), and the recipient’s number (myCellPhone) ❸.",

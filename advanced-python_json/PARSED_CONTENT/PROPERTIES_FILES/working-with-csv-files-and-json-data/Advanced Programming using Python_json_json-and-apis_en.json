This is known as providing an <span style=\"\">application</span> programming interface (API). Accessing an API is the same as accessing any other web page via a URL. The difference is that the data returned by an API is formatted (with JSON, for example) for machines; APIs aren’t easy for people to read.",
	"json-and-apis_key5": "Many websites make their data available in JSON format. Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, Google, Tumblr, Wikipedia, Flickr, Data.gov, Reddit, IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, LinkedIn, and many other popular sites offer APIs for programs to use. Some of these sites require registration, which is almost always free. You’ll have to find documentation for what URLs your program needs to request in order to get the data you want, as well as the general format of the JSON data structures that are returned. This documentation should be provided by whatever site is offering the API; if they have a “Developers” page, look for the documentation there.",

JSON can’t store every kind of <span style=\"\">Python</span> value. It can contain values of only the following data types: <span style=\"\">strings</span>, <span style=\"\">integers</span>, <span style=\"\">floats</span>, Booleans, lists, dictionaries, and NoneType.

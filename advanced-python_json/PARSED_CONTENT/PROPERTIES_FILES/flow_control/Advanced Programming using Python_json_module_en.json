Each module is a <span style=\"\">Python</span> program that contains a related group of functions that can be embedded in your programs. For example, the math module has mathematics-related functions, the random module has random number–related functions, and so on.",
	"module_key3": "Before you can use the functions in a module, you must import the module with an import <span style=\"\">statement</span>. In <span style=\"\">code</span>, an import <span style=\"\">statement</span> consists of the following:",

However, you can cause the program to terminate, or exit, by calling the sys.exit() function. Since this function is in the sys module, you have to import sys before your program can use it.",

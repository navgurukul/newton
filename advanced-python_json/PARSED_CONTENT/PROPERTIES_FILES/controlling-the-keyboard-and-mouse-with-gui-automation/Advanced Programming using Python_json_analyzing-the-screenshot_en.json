Before calling the click() method, you could take a screenshot and look at the pixel where the script is about to click. If it’s not the same gray as the gray button, then your program knows something is wrong. Maybe the window moved unexpectedly, or maybe a pop-up dialog has blocked the button. At this point, instead of continuing—and possibly wreaking havoc by clicking the wrong thing—your program can “see” that it isn’t clicking on the right thing and stop itself.",

This method can be useful to call whenever your GUI automation programs are about to call click(). Note that the color at the given coordinates must exactly match.

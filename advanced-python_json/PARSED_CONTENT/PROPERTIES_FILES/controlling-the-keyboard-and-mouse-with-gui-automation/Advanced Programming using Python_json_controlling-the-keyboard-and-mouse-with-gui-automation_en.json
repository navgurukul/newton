The ultimate tools for automating tasks on your computer are programs you write that directly control the <span style=\"\">key</span>board and mouse. These programs can control other <span style=\"\">applications</span> by sending them virtual <span style=\"\">keys</span>trokes and mouse clicks, just<span style=\"\">python3</span>- as if you were sitting at your computer and interacting with the <span style=\"\">applications</span> yourself. This technique is known as graphical user interface automation, or GUI automation for short.

In fact, it might be too fast for other programs to keep up with. Also, if something goes wrong but your program keeps moving the mouse around, it will be hard to tell what exactly the program is doing or how to recover from the problem. Like the enchanted brooms from Disney’s The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, which kept filling—and then overfilling—Mic<span style=\"\">key</span>’s tub with water, your program could get out of control even though it’s following your instructions perfectly. Stopping the program can be difficult if the mouse is moving around on its own, preventing you from clicking the IDLE window to close it. Fortunately, there are several ways to prevent or recover from GUI automation problems."

As you model more complicated things, you may find you need dictionaries and lists that contain other dictionaries and lists. Lists are useful to contain an ordered series of values, and dictionaries are useful for associating <span style=\"\">keys</span> with values. For example, here’s a program that uses a dictionary that contains other dictionaries in order to see who is bringing what to a picnic. The totalBrought() function can read this data structure and calculate the total number of an item being brought by all the guests.",

Inside the <span style=\"\">loop</span>, the <span style=\"\">string</span> of the guest’s name is assigned to k, and the dictionary of picnic items they’re bringing is assigned to v. If the item parameter exists as a <span style=\"\">key</span> in this dictionary, it’s value (the quantity) is added to numBrought ❷. If it does not exist as a <span style=\"\">key</span>, the get() method returns 0 to be added to numBrought.",

As you gain more experience, you may come up with more efficient models, but the important thing is that the data model works for your program’s needs.",

	"nested-dictionaries-and-lists_key13": "You learned all about dictionaries in this chapter. Lists and dictionaries are values that can contain multiple values, including other lists and dictionaries. Dictionaries are useful because you can map one item (the <span style=\"\">key</span>) to another (the value), as opposed to lists, which simply contain a series of values in order. Values inside a dictionary are accessed using square brackets just as with lists. Instead of an <span style=\"\">integer</span> index, dictionaries can have <span style=\"\">keys</span> of a variety of data types: <span style=\"\">integers</span>, <span style=\"\">floats</span>, <span style=\"\">strings</span>, or tuples. By organizing a program’s values into data structures, you can create representations of real-world objects. You saw an example of this with a tic-tac-toe board."

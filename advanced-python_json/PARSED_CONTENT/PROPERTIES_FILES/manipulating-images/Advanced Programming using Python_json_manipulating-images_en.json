The module has several functions that make it easy to crop, resize, and edit the content of an image. With the power to manipulate images the same way you would with software such as Microsoft Paint or Adobe Photoshop, <span style=\"\">Python</span> can automatically edit hundreds or thousands of images with ease.",

But before you continue, install the pillow module. See Appendix A for help installing third-party modules.",

Once the program execution returns from spam, that local scope is destroyed, and there is no longer a <span style=\"\">variable</span> named eggs. So when your program tries to run print(eggs), <span style=\"\">Python</span> gives you an <span style=\"\">error</span> saying that eggs is not defined. This makes sense if you think about it; when the program execution is in the global scope, no local scopes exist, so there canâ€™t be any local <span style=\"\">variables</span>. This is why only global <span style=\"\">variables</span> can be used in the global scope."

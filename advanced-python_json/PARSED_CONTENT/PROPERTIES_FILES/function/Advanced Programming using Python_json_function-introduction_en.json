	"function-introduction_key1": "You’re already familiar with the print(), <span style=\"\">input</span>(), and len() functions from the previous chapters. <span style=\"\">Python</span> provides several builtin functions like these, but you can also write your own functions. A function is like a mini-program within a program.",
	"function-introduction_key2": "To better understand how functions work, let’s create one. Type this program into the <span style=\"\">file</span> <span style=\"\">editor</span> and <span style=\"\">save</span> it as helloFunc.py:",
	"function-introduction_key3": "The first line is a def <span style=\"\">statement</span> ❶, which defines a function named hello(). The <span style=\"\">code</span> in the block that follows the def <span style=\"\">statement</span> ❷ is the body of the function. This <span style=\"\">code</span> is <span style=\"\">execute</span>d when the function is called, not when the function is first defined.",
	"function-introduction_key4": "The hello() lines after the function ❸ are function calls. In <span style=\"\">code</span>, a function call is just the function’s name followed by parentheses, possibly with some number of arguments in between the parentheses. When the program execution reaches these calls, it will jump to the top line in the function and begin executing the <span style=\"\">code</span> there. When it reaches the end of the function, the execution returns to the line that called the function and continues moving through the <span style=\"\">code</span> as before.",
	"function-introduction_key5": "Since this program calls hello() three times, the <span style=\"\">code</span> in the hello() function is <span style=\"\">execute</span>d three times. When you run this program, the <span style=\"\">output</span> looks like this:",
	"function-introduction_key6": "Howdy!<br>Howdy!!!<br>Hello there.<br>Howdy!<br>Howdy!!!<br>Hello there.<br>Howdy!<br>Howdy!!!",
	"function-introduction_key7": "Hello there.<br>A major purpose of functions is to group <span style=\"\">code</span> that gets <span style=\"\">execute</span>d multiple times. Without a function defined, you would have to copy and paste this <span style=\"\">code</span> each time, and the program would look like this:",
	"function-introduction_key8": "In general, you always want to avoid duplicating <span style=\"\">code</span>, because if you ever decide to update the <span style=\"\">code</span>—if, for example, you find a bug you need to fix—you’ll have to remember to change the <span style=\"\">code</span> everywhere you copied it.",
	"function-introduction_key9": "As you get more programming experience, you’ll often find yourself deduplicating <span style=\"\">code</span>, which means getting rid of duplicated or copy-and-pasted <span style=\"\">code</span>. Deduplication makes your programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update."

This way, you can have your home computer begin downloads while you’re away, and the (completely legal, not at all piratical) download can be finished by the time you return home."

In particular, you might want to require that the emails contain a password, since it is fairly trivial for hackers to fake a “from” address in emails. The program should delete the emails it finds so that it doesn’t repeat instructions every time it checks the email account. As an extra feature, have the program email or text you a confirmation every time it <span style=\"\">executes</span> a command. Since you won’t be sitting in front of the computer that is running the program, it’s a good idea to use the logging functions (see Chapter 10) to write a text <span style=\"\">file</span> log that you can check if <span style=\"\">errors</span> come up."

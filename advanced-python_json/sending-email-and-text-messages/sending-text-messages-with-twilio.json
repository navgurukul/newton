Twilio is an SMS gateway service, which means it’s a service that allows you to send text messages from your programs. Although you will be limited in how many texts you can send per month and the texts will be prefixed with the words Sent from a Twilio trial account, this trial service is probably adequate for your personal programs. The free trial is indefinite; you won’t have to upgrade to a paid plan later."

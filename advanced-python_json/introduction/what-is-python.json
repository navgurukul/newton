		"component": "text",
		"value": "To solve a Sudoku puzzle, the numbers 1 through 9 must be filled in for each row, each column, and each 3×3 interior square of the full 9×9 board.

For example, since 5 appears in the top left of the Sudoku puzzle shown in Figure 1, it cannot appear elsewhere in the top row, in the leftmost column, or in the top-left 3×3 square. Solving one row, column, or square at a time will provide more number clues for the rest of the puzzle."

Similarly, when debugging programs (that is, finding and fixing <span style=\"\">errors</span>), you’ll patiently observe what the program is doing and find the cause of the bugs.

	"callbacks-in-synchronous-functions_key4": "In the example above, addOne(1) `executes` first. Once it’s done, addOne(2) begins to `execute`. Once addOne(2) is done, addOne(3) `executes`. This process goes on until the last line of `code` gets `execute`d.\n",

	"callbacks-in-synchronous-functions_key8": "In this case, getLessThanFive is the callback. Array.filter is a function that accepts a callback function.\n",

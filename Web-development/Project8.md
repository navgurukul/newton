```ngMeta
name: Random MOM writers
```
In a group of people if any meeting is happening , big problem is who will document the discussion that happened in meeting.

no one will also raise hands that i will write voluntarily.

For that what we designed is we will choose randomly 2 names from listof students and say them to write a mom.

See the example here https://codepen.io/navgurukul/full/jyNppO/

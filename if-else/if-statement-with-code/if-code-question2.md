You have a variable called `varx` with the value as shown:

```python
varx = 300 - 123
```

Create a flowchart to take a number as input from the user. Convert this input to integer. Check if it is equal to `varx`. 

If the number is equal to varx, print **"Equal"** else print **"Not equal"**.

Upload the flowchart as well as python file.

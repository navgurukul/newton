	"Introduction_key2": "For example, when we write the following line in JS,",
	"Introduction_key3": "The <span style=\"\">variable</span> my_name can store some information. And the type of that information is a <span style=\"\">String</span>, like ‘Shweta’ in this case.",
	"Introduction_key4": "There are <b>six basic data types</b> in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: primitive (or primary), composite, and special data types. ",
	"Introduction_key5": "<span style=\"\">String</span>, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. ",
	"Introduction_key6": "Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. ",
	"Introduction_key7": "Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.",
	"Introduction_key8": "Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas composite data types can hold collections of values and more complex entities. Let's discuss each one of them in detail."
